				<outline text="Is recognizing rights of citizens in the United States a bad thing? My understanding of the United States Constitution is that its purpose is to prevent the Federal government from becoming tyrannical by narrowing its power to enumerated rights. The Constitution does not exist to define the rights of citizens and **I am pretty sure Madison did not imagine that the Bill of Rights defined the only rights of U.S. citizens.** Therefore it seems to me that the very act of removing rights from citizens through declaring that SCOTUS decisions granted rights not provided for in the Constitution is the exact opposite of an originalist understanding of the Constitution. Roe v. Wade restrains the Federal government from taking a women's right of autonomy over their own body, a right by the way that many of been claiming is the reason why things like &quot;mask mandates&quot; and &quot;vaccine mandates' are not constitutional.

				<outline text="My guess is that many of us view this day differently, and yet others think it overwrought. To me the heart of the matter is the elevation of individualism to a religion. You might call it American Christianity. Individualism by default creates dualism, winners and losers, true Americans and not true Americans, and it does not see the value of the &quot;public&quot; (we) except only to the extent that it benefits me. Surely this is the lesson of COVID, and I think it is the true lesson of January 6, 2020.   " created="Thu, 06 Jan 2022 14:38:52 GMT" type="outline"/>
				<outline text="In my opinion too many U.S. citizens do not have an understanding of the country's foundational documents, particularly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ushistory.org/declaration/document/index.html&quot;&gt;the Declaration of Independence&lt;/a&gt;. For most the Declaration and Constitution boil down to one word, liberty. Indeed, the Declaration layed out the case for why the colonies were declaring their freedom (independence) from England. However, to me the most important part of the Declaration is the statement of why we had the right to declare our freedom and create our own government: &quot;We hold these truths to be self-evident, that &lt;b&gt;all men are created equal&lt;/b&gt;...&quot;  We can do this, we said, because we are created the same as you, King George. Citizens of the United States consider liberty precious, but true liberty is built upon our equality, and true equality is something not yet fully attained in the United States. The extent of which we fight equality, we put the liberty of one group of citizens over the liberty of other citizens. Liberty does not co-exist within supremacy.

When at my desk I am connecting the Macbook to a 32 inch BenQ monitor via a USB-C dock and because I am using the Macbook's keyboard, the monitors are arranged in System Preferences Displays settings as vertically stacked, with the external display above the internal display. I have the external display set as the primary but what has been frustrating is that the OS X dock doesn't automatically move up to the primary display.

				<outline text="Congratulations to Atlanta Braves fans who are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/32538651/atlanta-braves-beat-houston-astros-first-world-series-championship-1995&quot;&gt;celebrating their teams World Series championship&lt;/a&gt; victory. Watching the game last night gave me all the feels as it was the five year anniversary of &lt;a href=&quot;http://writing.frankmcpherson.org/2016/11/03/thisIsTheYear.html&quot;&gt;the greatest game every played&lt;/a&gt;.  I will forever have a bit of disbelief that I lived to see the Chicago Cubs win the World Series. I know that as a fan I am supposed to want my team to win it all every year, but even though since 2016 the Cubs have ultimately lost in the playoffs those loses were not as crushing in context of 2016. The Cubs NLCS loses in 1984, 1989, and 2003 were crushing as I had never seen them in the World Series. I'll always be bitter about 1984 because frankly, they were the best National League team that year and should have played the Tigers." created="Wed, 03 Nov 2021 13:54:55 GMT" type="outline"/>

				<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.manton.org/2021/11/02/a-new-app.html&quot;&gt;Epilogue&lt;/a&gt; is a new entry in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://micro.blog&quot;&gt;micro.blog&lt;/a&gt; suite of apps, currently in beta, that can be used to manage your micro.blog &lt;a href=&quot;https://frankmcpherson.blog/reading/&quot;&gt;book shelves&lt;/a&gt;. You can also write &lt;a href=&quot;https://frankmcpherson.blog/2021/11/02/wholehearted-faith-which.html&quot;&gt;blog posts&lt;/a&gt; to your site from within the app.  I am not sure a separate app is the way to go here, but I think I will find it useful all the same. Shortcut support (or share sheet support) to provide some integration between the Kindle app and Epilogue would be great. Since bookshelves are lists, export to OPML format would also be great.

				<outline text="When I &lt;a href=&quot;https://store.google.com/magazine/compare_pixel?hl=en-US&amp;toggler0=Pixel+6+Pro&amp;toggler1=Pixel+6&amp;toggler2=Pixel+4a&quot;&gt;compare the Pixel 6 to my Pixel 4a&lt;/a&gt; the differences in the camera really jump out. I confess that given the price and the features that if I were in the market for a new phone I would be buying the Pixel 6. BTW, I really like that Google provides a way to compare the current and new Pixel phones with the old Pixels, all the way back to the first Pixel. Wish they would include the Nexus phones for comparison. I wasn't expecting to find the Pixel 6 so attractive." created="Tue, 19 Oct 2021 18:53:13 GMT" type="outline"/>
				<outline text="My main beef with the Pixel 6 is that it is a tad too large. The largest phone I have carried is the Nexus 6P, which was 6.27 inches tall and a little over 3 inches wide, and while I got used to it I always felt it too large. When Google released the Pixel 2 I frankly couldn't switch fast enough because it was 5.74 inches tall and a little skinnier at 2.74 inches wide. The Pixel 4a I now carry has the same physical size with a larger screen that I find perfect. Sadly, the Pixel 5a is now the smallest Google phone at 6.1 inches and the new Pixel 6 is at 6.2 inches. I have never carried a phone as large as the new Pixel 6 Pro that is 6.5 inches tall. I fear we may never see a sub 6 inch Pixel phone again, but at least the larger phones have larger batteries." created="Tue, 19 Oct 2021 18:40:56 GMT" type="outline"/>
				<outline text="My first impression having watched the ending of the presentation is that Google has hit it out of the park with this release of Android 12 and the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro. I've been running Android 12 for several weeks and I really like all of the UI improvements. The Pixel 6 and 6 Pro are priced very favorably and is going to put to test the question of whether a well designed Android phone can seriously compete with the iPhone. It looks like Google is all-in on marketing the Pixel 6. The question is, when one walks in to a Best Buy or a AT&amp;T store which phone do people in those stores steer customers toward? Another question is going to be build quality. Google has suffered in the past with defective devices that leave bad impressions so they must step up their quality control game. Only time will tell.

				<outline text="Just clicked System Update on my Pixel 4, and an update is available to Download and install. I expect this to be the production update. It's a 3.84 MB download because I already have the Android 12 release candidate, which was the final beta, installed.

				<outline text="Where have all the cicadas gone? Inline image support is not yet part of the Drummer integration with microblog.

Success! We have a new post created, but what about edits? Very cool, I can even edit a post. I now see a way that Drummer is emerging as a bigger writing tool than I may have originally envisioned.

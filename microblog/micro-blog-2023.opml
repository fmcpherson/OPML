				<outline text="It's another MLB offseason, deep in to December, during which the Chicago Cubs have yet to sign any free agent. &lt;a href=&quot;https://frankmcpherson.blog/2022/12/20/will-the-chicago.html&quot;&gt;By this time last year&lt;/a&gt; the Cubs had signed Dansby Swanson after seeing the other top tier free agents go to other teams. Back in November when people were reacting to the Cubs hiring Gregg Counsell as manager &lt;a href=&quot;https://frankmcpherson.blog/2023/11/08/i-keep-reading.html&quot;&gt;I was skeptical that that hire was a sign that the Cubs were going to be aggressive&lt;/a&gt; in the free agent market. I believe that Hoyer most likes Counsell's success without having top tier players, so I expect more of the same. Really. of such free agents only Cody Bellinger remains and I suspect the length of contract he wants is not what Hoyer is willing to give. I don't see the Cubs returning to the World Series as long as Hoyer is in charge.  " created="Wed, 20 Dec 2023 14:39:00 GMT" type="outline"/>

Unfortunately, support for keyboard shortcuts is highly dependent on Javascript and that seems prone to breakage. It seems about every four months or so the keyboard shortcuts in Reader stop working, and we are in one of those phases. Right now I am seeing shortcuts disappearing just about every time I move from one article to the next, to restore them I have to reload the page. I've found the problem exists in Chrome and Firefox.

				<outline text="I think the biggest consequence to &lt;a href=&quot;https://om.co/2023/12/11/microsoft-afl-cio-ai-deal/&quot;&gt;what Om predicts&lt;/a&gt; is a potential shift in how we direct young people toward professions that provide for a good life. (aka &quot;the American dream&quot;). When I grew up, and I think it is still the case, it was implied that the best professions, in most cases defined as the ones for which there is a greatest income potential, are white collar, which are the type of jobs at risk.  The attack on unions starting in the 1980's to just recently implied such &quot;blue collar/union&quot; jobs are &quot;less than&quot; non-union, white collar jobs. The huge wealth gap in the United States is a consequence of this direction, which has also transformed the U.S. economy from manufacturing to services. It appears that AI  has the potential to force a re-calibration of what we consider good jobs, ironically through the same automation that eliminated so many blue collar jobs during the last thirty years." created="Wed, 13 Dec 2023 16:55:17 GMT" type="outline"/>

				<outline text="I think most people intuitively know the corruptible nature of wealth, and that is why they don't trust any of our institutions. We see any report from a media outlet as simply a vehicle for making money. We believe doctors prescribe drugs that they get paid to push. We believe lawmakers only exist to pass laws for companies from which they have already been paid via lobbyists. Yet, we buy the idea that a corruptible private entity is better than a public one and so we want a government that does nothing in favor of corporations doing everything and consequently we don't favor publicly funded research. In my opinion the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-stop-openai-governance-structure-meltdown/&quot;&gt;what we saw play out this past month with OpenAI&lt;/a&gt; is trying to graft the idea of a public good on to a capitalistic entity and that is incompatible because profits will drive every decision.

					<outline text="I am reading Jonathan Haidt's article in The Atlantic, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/09/the-coddling-of-the-american-mind/399356/&quot;&gt;The Coddling of the American Mind&lt;/a&gt;, and I am wondering whether the hypersensitivity to emotional wellbeing Haidt describes can be somewhat attributed to our associating gun violence to mental illness over the last several decades. Mental illnesses are real but I think are diminished when we start tossing out the term as being the cause to all our ills. Perhaps it would not be an issue if we actually did something about mental illness, but I think we mostly talk about it. Our unwillingness to actually address problems and instead simply focus on symptoms is teaching generations of people that symptoms are actually the problems when they are not.

					<outline text="What Haidt does not address in the article is how hypercapitalism, which is the practice in the United States of prioritizing wealth over everything, contributes to the problem. We have many religions in the United States, but I think capitalism is the one that rules them all. The religion of capitalism preaches that there are to be no restraints on one's ability to be wealthy and thus it teaches that the ends justify the means.

					<outline text="Manipulating emotions may be the number one tool of generating wealth in the United States. Marketing and advertising is emotional manipulation for the purpose of selling products, the buying of which produces wealth.

Technology continually optimizes advertising and today's targeted and viral ads are extremely effective at making us covet. " created="Wed, 06 Dec 2023 15:34:44 GMT" type="outline"/>

Jed Hoyer has stated that &lt;a href=&quot;https://theathletic.com/5042418/2023/11/07/cubs-jed-hoyer-craig-counsell/&quot;&gt;he has admired Counsell's success&lt;/a&gt; in Milwaukee given the budget constraints. I believe that Hoyer is convinced that his way of NOT paying a lot of money for free agents is the correct path, and signing Counsell enables him to continue that strategy and be successful. Counsell might have signed with the Cubs thinking he is stepping up to a big market team, but in practice the Cubs have more in common with the Brewers. It is more than likely that the Cubs do not sign the likes of Bellinger and Ohtani and instead stick to their history of signing bottom top to top mid tier players. &lt;a href=&quot;https://theathletic.com/5042294/2023/11/08/cubs-offseason-plan-craig-counsell/&quot;&gt;None of the players the Cubs signed after hiring Joe Maddon&lt;/a&gt; were top tier at that time, including Jon Lester.

					<outline text="Whenever a general manager/front office of a professional sports team fires a good coach, or in baseball manager, I am suspicious of the true motivations behind the decision. I tend to think such decisions are often deflections of attention away from the front office. Today the Chicago Cubs &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbcsportschicago.com/mlb/chicago-cubs/cubs-news/read-cubs-statement-firing-david-ross/517114/&quot;&gt;dismissed David Ross&lt;/a&gt; and hired Gregg Counsell and many will note similarities in this decision with how they &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.espn.com/chicago/mlb/story/_/id/11797575/chicago-cubs-fire-manager-rick-renteria-one-season&quot;&gt;dismissed Ricky Renteria in 2014 to hire Joe Maddon&lt;/a&gt; who unexpectedly become available. I personally do not think the two situations are the same." created="Mon, 06 Nov 2023 21:00:05 GMT" type="outline"/>
					<outline text="Renteria had been on the job for only one year, had not really proven himself as a manager, and did not have any history with the Cubs. Ross is one of the heros of the 2016 world championship team and had taken the Cubs to the playoffs as a manager. Counsell is a good manager and had taken the Brewers to the playoffs five of his six seasons with them, but did not have success in the playoffs. I do not think Counsell is as good a manager today as Joe Maddon was in 2014." created="Mon, 06 Nov 2023 21:04:49 GMT" type="outline"/>
					<outline text="More important, David Ross was not the reason why the Cubs did not make the playoffs this season. The Cubs did not make the playoffs because of a depleted bullpen and in my opinion bad offseason acquisitions that were eventually released during the season, and those decisions were made by the general manager and president of baseball operations.

If the Cubs have decided to completely move on from 2016 that means moving on from Jed Hoyer. In my opinion, the Cubs released the wrong person from their team.

The argument against free will appears predicated on the idea that for it to exist decisions must be able to made without any outside influence, and what that really seems to argue against is randomness.

Once something different, the World Series today is a tournament, and the season records are merely tickets for entry into the tournament and the scheduling of opponents and games. Every tournament format of every sport brings to the fore the hottest team at the moment, which is not necessarily the best team of the field.  Tournaments exist because they generate a lot of money and do so because of Cinderella stories.  March Madness, the NCAA men's basketball tournament, basically funds the entire NCAA. My recommendations to fans are, first recognize your team just only won opportunity to play in the tournament, and next, make note of how well the team is playing in the weeks leading up to the start of the tournament.

I do agree with what I wrote back in 2019, I'd rather be in the position of being disappointed that a good team did not succeed than always rooting for bad teams who occasionally surprise. The Cubs lost last night after having a 6-0 lead. In many ways the game encapsulates their current state, some good pitching to gain a lead or stay close, but not enough pitching to sustain the lead through 9 innings. In that state all other facets of the game have to be played near flawlessly, so a fielding error can (and last night was) be fatal. Good news is that the one loss does not put them out of the playoff standings, but they cannot lose two games in a row now and when they do lose they are at the mercy of how other teams perform.

				<outline text="Why The Cubs  Are Fading" created="Tue, 19 Sep 2023 14:49:08 GMT" type="outline">
					<outline text="The World Series, like most major sports championships, is won by defense. In baseball that mainly translates to pitching, but also fielding. When you play the same team in a playoff series your hitters usually face the opponent's best pitching, consequently you should plan for 3 or fewer runs scored and that means you want your pitching to hold the opponent to 3 or fewer runs. " created="Tue, 19 Sep 2023 14:46:37 GMT" type="outline"/>
					<outline text="Since the beginning of September the Cubs have been in playoff games. Nearly all of the teams they faced need to beat them to move ahead of the Cubs in the Wild Card playoff standings. By my count the Cubs have played 17 games so far in September and in 7 of them their opponent scored 3 or fewer runs. My conclusion is that the Cubs pitching is simply not good enough to win in the playoffs." created="Tue, 19 Sep 2023 14:49:35 GMT" type="outline"/>
					<outline text="I think my conclusion holds if you look at the larger body of work over the season. I expect that in a high percentage of the games the Cubs won they scored 4 or more runs, too many of those they needed to score 4 or more runs. During the regular season it is not surprising that your hitters will have more success because they will be in many situations where they face poor pitching. " created="Tue, 19 Sep 2023 14:52:10 GMT" type="outline"/>
					<outline text="A team built to win in the MLB playoffs has the pitching that more often than not can hold their opponent to 3 or fewer runs. Truth is the Cubs got through the 2023 season with only one reliable starting pitcher, maybe two (Steele for sure, and possibly Hendricks). Stroman and Taillon have not been consistent and Taillon has been aweful. Javier Assad joined the starting rotation too late in to the season so it is really hard to assess his reliability. The bullpen is no better, only Merrywather and Alzolay has been reliable, though Leiter is borderline. " created="Tue, 19 Sep 2023 14:54:53 GMT" type="outline"/>
					<outline text="The fact that the Cubs are in a playoff race is much more important this year than they actually make the playoffs, and the goal long term is be winning division championships and not gain a playoff berth via the wild card. While at the beginning of the season there was some hope the Cubs could compete with the Brewers for the NL Central division championship, I think it was evident early on through head to head games with the Brewers that this Cubs team is not as good or better than the Brewers. Sure, the Cubs can win any game, but can they win a series? " created="Tue, 19 Sep 2023 15:01:56 GMT" type="outline"/>
					<outline text="Bottom line, the Chicago Cubs are on schedule for their long term goals of winning division titles and the World Series in upcoming years. Clearly, the Cubs need to improve their pitching. Jordan Wicks has shown he is a piece of the puzzle for next year, and we can hope Taillon will return to the how he pitched in the past. Stroman might be back, but with Hendricks being another year older I think the Cubs need to sign at least two reliable starting pitchers during the off season as well as keep Merryweather. " created="Tue, 19 Sep 2023 15:05:48 GMT" type="outline"/>
					<outline text="From the lineup perspective, I think the Cubs should be aggressive in their attempt to sign Bellinger, but I doubt he stays and his departure will create a big gap in their lineup. Maybe youngsters Morel, Mervis, or Crow-Armstrong can help fill that gap but all are too inexperienced with MLB pitching. Consequently, the Cubs need to sign at least one big-name hitter to maintain their current starting lineup performance. " created="Tue, 19 Sep 2023 15:09:52 GMT" type="outline"/>
					<outline text="Finally, the biggest question of the off season might be whether David Ross has what it takes to manage a championship caliber baseball team. Every manager makes questionable lineup and in-game decisions, and this is Ross' first manager job so we need to keep in mind that he is learning on the job. I personally can't pin the current Cubs situation on Ross, the bottom line is that the players have to perform and they are not performing. Ross has made lineup changes and pitching changes, as far as I can tell he is doing everything he can to try and have the Cubs win games. I would not be in a hurry to replace Ross unless there is a championship experienced person to replace him. So, David Ross' fate, like Rick Renteria's was in 2015, may be decided more by who is available rather than by his own performance. " created="Tue, 19 Sep 2023 15:12:52 GMT" type="outline"/>
					<outline text="I am frustrated by and mad about the Cub's performance this month, but I am mostly mad at the Cubs veterans who have under performed with the pressure on. Frankly, if it weren't for Suzuki the Cubs would probably would have a longer losing streak. Swanson, Bellinger, and Happ have not met expectations as the veteran leaders. In the big picture I am happy about where the Cubs are, they met my expectations for this season and look to be on track of near year and beyond. All of the younger Cub players who have never been in this position of a playoff race in September are gaining valuable experience of how to deal with the pressure, and in my opinion experience matters most." created="Tue, 19 Sep 2023 15:22:55 GMT" type="outline"/>

The rich white men founded a ruling class (government) that established liberty for their ability to remain rich and their only concern for others was to the extent that they supported their cause. Ironically, because America was the first to form something that looked like self-government over time other countries used the U.S. Constitution as the blueprint for founding their own democracies. However, it appears that none of those countries established their constitutions for the purpose of securing an oligarchy, and so &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/09/american-constitution-norway/675199/?utm_source=feed&quot;&gt;over time they made reforms to be more democratic&lt;/a&gt;. The United States has not made such reforms to dismantle the oligarchy and so life in the U.S. goes on as intended for the benefit of a minority of wealthy people.

					<outline text="The 162 game schedule is a big part of what makes Major League Baseball unique among professional sports in the United States because it tends to force differences in how games are approached throughout the season. No team is ever going to be undefeated, the current best team, the Atlanta Braves, has won a little over 65% of their games. The MLB season is a marathon meaning that in most cases a game is not treated as &quot;must win.&quot; " created="Tue, 29 Aug 2023 20:51:28 GMT" type="outline"/>
					<outline text="Oddly, while a long schedule means most games are not &quot;must win,&quot; for some teams, earlier than they would like, the season transitions to &quot;it doesn't matter whether they win or lose&quot; because they are out of playoff contention. As a lifelong Chicago Cubs fan it has been my experience more often than not that the Cubs are out of playoff contention by the end of May or early June. Further, as a lifelong Cubs fan, I have learned it is much more fun watching games year after year when the team is playing meaningful games in September.

					<outline text="So, in baseball, a transition occurs over the course of a season where teams move from playing to win games to playing to must win games. The benefit of expanding the number of playoff teams is that more teams start playing more &quot;must win&quot; games in September than in years past. In my experience, teams with players who have the most experience winning &quot;must win&quot; games are best positioned for long term success. " created="Tue, 29 Aug 2023 21:04:00 GMT" type="outline"/>
					<outline text="As an aside, it should be obvious why wild card teams, which have worse records than division winners, have had so much success in the playoffs, it's because they usually play more &quot;must win&quot; games during the last month of the season and through that gain valuable experience and confidence.

(Let that sink in a moment, thanks due to the new &quot;balanced&quot; MLB schedule.) Obviously, the streak had to end eventually, but the Cards have proven to be very beatable and we had every reason to expect the Cubs to win today too. Tomorrow night the Cubs start a four game series against the Reds at home, and they need to win the first game as they can no longer afford losing streaks. Even more importantly, the Cubs are 3.5 games behind the Reds in the NL Central standings and we do not want to fall further behind. The Cubs have an opportunity to pull closer to the Reds and Brewers this week and therefore solidify being in the hunt for the remainder of the season. Losing 3 out of 4 of these games against the Reds might actually be too difficult to overcome. Ross needs to be putting the best lineup in every game for this series, I do not want to see Mancini at first and Morel in place other than DH. Play Gomes in all of these games.

What such a trade tells me is that the Cubs continue to tread mediocrity and have no real plan for returning to the playoffs. Further, if the Cubs trade Stroman and thus are sellers at the deadline ownership must make a change in the front office and the manager.

Now, because most teams in baseball are not very good, most teams are unloading their best players mid season for prospects that might never make it to the majors or at best won't be on their team until 3 years down the road. Every off season teams buy a bunch of free agents (basically creating new rosters every year), all who are unknowns, and hope they perform well enough to form a competitive team.

I think the Internet is one such case, with those who have never lived without the Internet expecting all matters related to time happening much faster than my generation and older who grew up without the Internet. The &quot;Internet&quot; generation will not tolerate society changes needing to take tens or hundreds of years of time (civil rights, women's rights, gay rights, etc..) to complete, they expect such change to happen in months if not days!

I don't understand why Fitbit has not included an app to let users get a reading on-demand, like like we can do with ECG.

				<outline text="I spend every work day in my home office that is located in the basement of our house, which can be 2 to 5 degrees cooler than the main floor, therefore I usually wear sweats rather than shorts. I also try to take four walks during the day, usually after each meal. When I walk I carry my phone and house key. I recently switched to the Pixel 7a that is heavier than the Pixel 4a I used previously, and I find it too heavy to carry comfortably in the pocket of my sweats.

It seems most people believe that a President can and should be able to simply make changes and that would make that person a king against which we declared our independence. Consequently, any person in power is going to encounter oppositional power and how that person handles it is an important skill. So, RFK Jr. has some opinions about affects of vaccines on autism, which he is certainly allowed to have, but what will he do with them? How does he view those who disagree with his opinions, with contempt or as an opponent? Too many people treat others with contempt and that is counter productive.

				<outline text="First Impressions Of The Google Pixel 7a" created="Fri, 02 Jun 2023 20:58:03 GMT" type="outline">
					<outline text="Google announced and began selling &lt;a href=&quot;https://store.google.com/product/pixel_7a?hl=en-US&quot;&gt;the Pixel 7a&lt;/a&gt; earlier last month, and I ordered a Sea colored version from Amazon about a week later. The Pixel 7a is replacing the Pixel 4a that has been my everyday carry phone for the last three years. I really like the size and feel of the Pixel 4a and so I was not eager to up-size to the newer phone, but it has come to the end of the road with Android and there are features the 7a has that make the upgrade a &quot;no-brainer.&quot;" created="Fri, 02 Jun 2023 20:58:20 GMT"/>
					<outline text="My main concern about the Pixel 7a has been its size and glossy back. The Pixel 7a is taller than the Pixel 4a and because of that I find it harder to operate with one hand. The weight, however, is the most noticeable difference. I am finding that due to the weight it is more comfortable holding the phone in my left hand, but in a position where I can't scroll apps with that same hand and as a result this phone requires more two hand operation than the Pixel 4a. The weight and size difference is also noticeable when I put the Pixel 7a in a front pant pocket. Fortunately, the size do not make these use cases impossible, just different and I suspect the difference will become less noticeable over time." created="Fri, 02 Jun 2023 21:02:13 GMT"/>
					<outline text="The back of the Pixel 7a is more &quot;polished&quot; than the Pixel 4a, but it doesn't feel so slippery that I fear it is going to quickly slip out of my hand. I purchased a &lt;a href=&quot;https://latercase.com/products/google-pixel-7a-thin-case?variant=40235135729750&quot;&gt;really nice Latercase&lt;/a&gt; that does not add much weight or bulk and gives a more matte like feel to the back of the phone." created="Fri, 02 Jun 2023 21:06:25 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Battery life appears to be better, but I don't know whether that is simply because the battery is larger or the Google Tensor G2 is that much more efficient. &lt;a href=&quot;https://accubatteryapp.com/&quot;&gt;Accubattery&lt;/a&gt; is showing that screen of battery consumption is at 2% or less, which is definitely better than the Pixel 4a that is closer to 3%.

I don't think the camera app clearly indicates how to switch between cameras." created="Fri, 02 Jun 2023 21:09:27 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I really like the under screen fingerprint scanner, although that may be more due to the fact that scanner is on the front of the phone rather than on the back. Now I know exactly where to put my finger and therefore the scanner works more accurately. The face unlock also works ok, but doesn't seem to trigger fast enough. People complain about the speed of the finger print scanner, but I find it plenty fast." created="Fri, 02 Jun 2023 21:10:27 GMT"/>

The fact that one has to factory reset a WearOS watch to move it from one Pixel phone to another is the clearest evidence of Google's cluelessness when it comes to tech ecosystems. At least the Pixel Buds were automatically recognized and work." created="Fri, 02 Jun 2023 21:11:31 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Of the new features I get with the Pixel 7a, I like the wireless charging the best, although I am still working on how often to do the charging. I bought the Pixel Stand and have it on my desk where I could put my phone during the work day, but what is the impact on battery health from keeping the phone on the charger for extended periods of time? Articles on lithium batteries say it's best to keep the phones between 20% to 80% charged given that each full cycle has an impact on the life time of the battery. Seems to me though that Google intends users to keep the phone on the stand, so you would think they would incorporate programming to help with the battery health. " created="Fri, 02 Jun 2023 21:14:33 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Over all I am happy with the Pixel 7a. It's larger than the Pixel 4a but it is the smallest Pixel, and I definitely think it is better to buy it than the cheaper and older Pixel 6a. Rumor is that the 7a may be the last of the &quot;A Series&quot; pixel phones, but it's not clear exactly what that means. It could mean that Google will stop staggering the release of phones in the spring/summer and fall/winter like they have over the last several years but keep the &quot;small, medium, and large&quot; sizes, or it could be they drop the phone all together. Given that the Pixel 7a has nearly all the same specs as the Pixel 7, it seems the only reason one would buy the &quot;flagship&quot; phone is to get a larger screen. I really hope that Google keeps a phone that is no larger than 6-inches tall. " created="Fri, 02 Jun 2023 21:19:56 GMT"/>

					<outline text="One of the unwritten rules of tech is the idea that more is better, the purpose of which is to have us continually buy the latest generation of a product. The rule began with the model year releases of automobiles and became adopted by the tech industry. Unfortunately, we consumers don't often enough question whether the latest features really do matter. We aren't helped by tech reviewers who often seem to advocate more for the tech industry than consumers. An example that I am thinking about is the push for faster refresh rates on smartphones." created="Tue, 23 May 2023 15:22:45 GMT" type="outline"/>
					<outline text="If you have read smartphone reviews over the last year or so you have probably been convinced that phones with 60Hz refresh screens are bad and really should be avoided. We all should be clamoring for 120Hz or at least 90Hz screens so that we get the fastest, smoothest screen scrolling. Do we, really, need smartphone screens faster than 60Hz?" created="Tue, 23 May 2023 15:29:10 GMT" type="outline"/>
					<outline text="Up until last week I have been using the Pixel 4a, and it's &quot;limited,&quot; 60Hz screen as my daily driver. When I got the new Pixel 7a I dutifully changed the setting, as prescribed by nearly all tech reviewers, to turn on Smooth Display so that it displays at 90Hz. Every reviewer who directs one to make this change intones something to the affect, &quot;why is Smooth Display not enabled by default?&quot;" created="Tue, 23 May 2023 15:33:13 GMT" type="outline"/>
					<outline text="While I can say, yes, after turning on Smooth Display scrolling text up/down on the Pixel 7a is faster, what nobody seems to ask is, on a 6-inch display, does one really need that scrolling to be faster? I am skeptical. I am thinking we are being convinced that faster smartphone refresh rates are needed, but they really are not. Increase the size of the screen to perhaps the 11-inch standard tablet, or larger, and I can see how faster refresh can really matter, but on a 6-inch screen? " created="Tue, 23 May 2023 15:35:55 GMT" type="outline"/>
					<outline text="Another example, at least to me, is the &quot;insistence&quot; that we all need 5G wireless data on our phones. Of course, I ran a speed test using the Pixel 7a as soon as I could and observed the fact that the 86 Mbps download feature is faster than the &quot;plain&quot; LTE transfer speed of my Pixel 4a. Ok, but in what way am I really going to notice or even need that faster transfer speed on a smartphone with a 6-inch screen? For example, I streamed video on the Pixel 7a and it looked no better to me than on the Pixel 4a. Again, if I were on a tablet or certainly a PC then I would likely benefit by the faster transfer rate, but I doubt that 5G is really going to make difference on the Pixel 7a." created="Tue, 23 May 2023 15:39:45 GMT" type="outline"/>
					<outline text="To be fair, I do gain some benefits in the upgrade from the Pixel 4a to the 7a. I am finding the front, under-screen finger print scanner is much better than the back scanner of the 4a. The camera is much better and thus I am getting better pictures. Battery life seems to be better, probably thanks to a larger battery and the Tensor G2 chip, and I am happy to finally have the convenience of wireless charging." created="Tue, 23 May 2023 15:45:11 GMT" type="outline"/>
					<outline text="Truth is, we likely reached peak smartphone many years ago, therefore there are really fewer needed new features that really matter, and consequently there is a need for more marketing to get people to buy phones. If you are wondering why Google will be selling the Pixel Fold, the reason why is because the smartphone &quot;industry&quot; is convinced such foldables are needed in order to keep selling phones over the next ten years. (The main case for foldables is people want to carry smaller devices, but ironically that could be served by selling phones with smaller screens!) In my opinion, the only change in smartphones that we really need is in battery life, and the technical problem of gaining more battery life from the same size batteries appears to be impossible to overcome. Ironically, one way to improve battery life is to set the screen refresh to 60Hz and use slower file transfer speeds, but then we could get by with last year's phone." created="Tue, 23 May 2023 15:48:57 GMT" type="outline"/>

					<outline text="I have now replaced two Pixel phones with a newer model and each time I do I am astounded by how little Google understands technology ecosystems. Not only does Google require physically connecting the two phones together with a cable to transfer data, but to transfer a WearOS watch, like the Pixel Watch, from one phone to another you have to factory reset the watch. Seriously! Does anyone at Google ever even try moving from one generation phone to another? " created="Sun, 21 May 2023 21:31:25 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Google seems to think that when one buys a new Pixel phone they are going to buy a new watch too. The factory reset of the watch would not be so bad if one could restore the watch like one can with a Pixel phone, but Google does not provide a backup of WearOS watches to their cloud. " created="Sun, 21 May 2023 21:35:15 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Here is the process for one who owns a Pixel Watch paired with a Pixel 4a to replace the phone with a Pixel 7a. You transfer the SIM from the old phone to the new, then connect a USB-C cable between the 4a and the 7a to transfer your phone settings (ring tones, etc..) and SMS messages. During the transfer the icons for your apps are added to the new phone, but then all of the apps have to be installed. In many cases app settings, particularly logins, do not transfer, so after the apps install you spend a considerable amount of time going through each app to be sure it works as on the &quot;old&quot; phone. " created="Sun, 21 May 2023 21:38:19 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Over the years I have replaced several iPads with newer models and never once have I ever had to physically connect a cable to move settings and apps between the tablets. Apple has been doing this for many years, and honestly, I do not understand why Google, with all of its technical brilliance cannot figure out how to make this process of transfering from one model Pixel phone to another as pain free as possible. " created="Sun, 21 May 2023 21:42:58 GMT"/>
					<outline text="So, once you have the phone set it comes time to pair the Pixel Watch to the new phone. The process requires doing a factory reset of the watch as if you just took it out of the box, and worse, after you pair it with the new phone there is no transfer of app icons, settings, or anything. Oh, and neither the Google Play store nor the Google Watch app keep track of what apps or watch faces you install on the watch, so you have figure out what to install! Anyone at Google who does such a transfer finds this acceptable ought to be embarrased, it might be the most brain dead process of all of technology! " created="Sun, 21 May 2023 21:45:08 GMT"/>
					<outline text="It's not like nobody at Google has figured it out. Transferring the Pixel Buds Pro from the Pixel 4a to the 7a works exactly how one expects, and how transferring a watch should work. No reset, no pairing, no manual configuration, just take the buds out of the case, put them in my ear, and they just work on the new phone! " created="Sun, 21 May 2023 21:50:26 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Like the Pixel Buds, the Pixel Watch is an accessory to Pixel Phones, but the WearOS, Android, and Pixel teams seem to think the Pixel Watch is a standalone device. Sure, one can buy a watch with an LTE radio and with it and the built-in GPS the watch can function apart from the phone, but honestly, most users are not buying watches with LTE radios. Even if they do, the process of using the Play Store app on the watch to find and install apps is best described as tedious. " created="Sun, 21 May 2023 21:53:36 GMT"/>
					<outline text="The worst part of the WearOS apps process is that Google actually had it right the first time it released their smartwatch operating system. When Google first released a smartwatch there was no way to install apps directly on the watch, you had to use the phone, and the companion app on the phone made it easy to manage the apps to install. Back then while recovering from a factory reset did not automatically restore the watch, it at least put all the apps you had installed in one spot so that you could manually trigger the installation. " created="Sun, 21 May 2023 21:57:16 GMT"/>
					<outline text="For all the progress Google has made over the years to improve Android, Pixel phones, and develop the Pixel Watch, the lack of emphasis on making the products work together seamlessly is a huge let down. Given there have been now been several iterations of Android, WearOS, and Pixel phones, there is no excuse for why the transfer process so brain dead. What I see is a lack of diligence and a willingness to accept things that are not good enough, and I have to question whether such a company unwilling to do things right ought to be trusted playing with technology such as Artificial Intelligence that could be dangerous.

It seems to me that a fundamental requirement of ethical behavior is actually caring about what others think. While Thomas' continued participation in extravagant trips that he does not pay to attend is not illegal, it creates the appears of quid pro quo. Ethics isn't about laws, it's about appearance and trust. Americans are right to not trust the Supreme Court when justices don't care about ethics, and given that the Supreme Court is the most authoritarian branch of the U.S. government, the lack of ethics is frightening.

I think anti-woke as it is being used is easier to define. Basically, whenever someone is claiming they are anti-woke they mean they oppose the enforcement of beliefs upon themselves or others. For some it's simply the label for ideas they don't agree with or norms/rules they don't want to abide by. I think at the root of this issue is a decrease in tolerance for each other. As an example, one side may say one must use proper pronouns in reference to a person, the other side says that one must not be forced to use certain words or have to listen to one other's beliefs because listening is the same as indoctrination.  There is no effort made to meet in the middle because each side wants their way, one side says they are just being polite, the other side says they are just using common sense.

Those who wish to use the iPad for use cases for which it was not originally intended are caught between the possibilities for how iPads could be used and the realities of how iPads can be used.

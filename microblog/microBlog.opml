Throughout the pandemic we have suffered from the desire for certainty and perfection. Perfection is the enemy of the better. Rapid tests won't detect all cases, so they don't guarantee one is not infected, BUT if a rapid test is positive you then clearly know you are a threat to spreading the infection to others and should definitely stay home, which is more information than the average person has before they walk out the door." created="Tue, 30 Nov 2021 19:50:36 GMT" type="outline"/>

I expect the macOS dock should appear on the BenQ but I haven't figured out how to make it consistently appear. It seems if I move the mouse cursor to just the right spot at the bottom of the display then the dock appears and stays, but not until then. If I move the mouse to the bottom of the internal display the dock then appears there and goes away from the BenQ.

I am starting to be pessimistic about the ownership's commitment to being competitive, there is the appearance of just collecting money from Wrigley Field tickets, betting, and all the non-baseball operations. In other words, a repeat of prior ownership that lead to 100 years of playoff futility. I really &lt;a href=&quot;https://bleacherreport.com/articles/825085-chicago-cubs-if-mark-cuban-had-bought-the-cubs-in-2008&quot;&gt;wish Mark Cuban had bought the team&lt;/a&gt; when he had the chance, I would not doubt his commitment to winning.

				<outline text="An observation. The 2020 edition Macbook Air is one substantial piece of metal. Not only does it handle compute processing like butter, but it can probably stop a bullet and do serious damage if I used it to hit someone at the right spot.

				<outline text="I am planning on buying a new Macbook during the holiday season, so I am keeping my eyes on the deals being offered. I am not in the market for the new high-end Pros as I don't need that much nor do I want to spend that much, but I do want at least 512 GB of storage, which pushes me to the high-end Air or the 13-inch Pro. I am leaning toward the Air, does anyone think the 13-inch Pro is the better way to go? I basically need a computer that runs current operating systems and I want it to last. I do hope to also run Windows 11 on it using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.parallels.com/&quot;&gt;Parallels&lt;/a&gt;.

Watching the game last night gave me all the feels as it was the five year anniversary of &lt;a href=&quot;http://writing.frankmcpherson.org/2016/11/03/thisIsTheYear.html&quot;&gt;the greatest game every played&lt;/a&gt;.  I will forever have a bit of disbelief that I lived to see the Chicago Cubs win the World Series. I know that as a fan I am supposed to want my team to win it all every year, but even though since 2016 the Cubs have ultimately lost in the playoffs those loses were not as crushing in context of 2016. The Cubs NLCS loses in 1984, 1989, and 2003 were crushing as I had never seen them in the World Series. I'll always be bitter about 1984 because frankly, they were the best National League team that year and should have played the Tigers." created="Wed, 03 Nov 2021 13:54:55 GMT" type="outline"/>

Shortcut support (or share sheet support) to provide some integration between the Kindle app and Epilogue would be great. Since bookshelves are lists, export to OPML format would also be great.

I confess that given the price and the features that if I were in the market for a new phone I would be buying the Pixel 6. BTW, I really like that Google provides a way to compare the current and new Pixel phones with the old Pixels, all the way back to the first Pixel.

				<outline text="My main beef with the Pixel 6 is that it is a tad too large. The largest phone I have carried is the Nexus 6P, which was 6.27 inches tall and a little over 3 inches wide, and while I got used to it I always felt it too large. When Google released the Pixel 2 I frankly couldn't switch fast enough because it was 5.74 inches tall and a little skinnier at 2.74 inches wide. The Pixel 4a I now carry has the same physical size with a larger screen that I find perfect. Sadly, the Pixel 5a is now the smallest Google phone at 6.1 inches and the new Pixel 6 is at 6.2 inches. I have never carried a phone as large as the new Pixel 6 Pro that is 6.5 inches tall.

I've been running Android 12 for several weeks and I really like all of the UI improvements. The Pixel 6 and 6 Pro are priced very favorably and is going to put to test the question of whether a well designed Android phone can seriously compete with the iPhone. It looks like Google is all-in on marketing the Pixel 6. The question is, when one walks in to a Best Buy or a AT&amp;T store which phone do people in those stores steer customers toward? Another question is going to be build quality. Google has suffered in the past with defective devices that leave bad impressions so they must step up their quality control game. Only time will tell.

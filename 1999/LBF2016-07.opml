				<outline text="Since I retained the URL for the site and pointed it to the new server, I didn't have to do any URL manipulation in my chatLog.json file. After installing the 1999 server software and testing with &lt;a href=&quot;http://readwrite.club:1999/users/frankm/2016/07/13/0100.html&quot;&gt;a simple hello world post&lt;/a&gt;, I copied over the chatLog.json and config.json files from the original server." created="Wed, 13 Jul 2016 17:11:35 GMT"/>

For example, right now I am using the Outlook watch face, which is connected to Outlook mobile on my phone and that is connected to my work Exchange server.

				<outline text="I told Google to set a timer for 10 minutes, which the watch promptly implemented and shortly the screen switched to always-on mode with the timer displaying and updating. I thought this was cool, it enables me to quickly see how much time is left before I flip the chicken.&amp;nbsp;" created="Sun, 17 Jul 2016 00:11:00 GMT"/>

If the origin of sin is the accepting of ourselves as apart from God, and consequently not seeing God in everyone around us (let alone within ourselves), then we move from us to you and I, or seeing the world as me and others. The word we have for this today is racism, and it should be no surprise that it persists and will continue to persist as long as we continue to see ourselves and everyone around us as apart from each other and apart from God." created="Tue, 19 Jul 2016 14:05:02 GMT"/>

				<outline text="Today marks the end of the first week that I have owned and worn the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gethuawei.com/huawei-watch&quot;&gt;Huawei Watch&lt;/a&gt;,  so it's a good time to provide an update on how I am liking it. In short, I am very happy with this watch." created="Fri, 22 Jul 2016 17:23:48 GMT"/>
				<outline text="The main problem I had with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gsmarena.com/motorola_moto_360_(1st_gen)-7682.php&quot;&gt;the original Moto 360&lt;/a&gt; is its battery life. My benchmark for mobile device battery life is that I shouldn't have to worry about it, which means there needs to be battery life available until I go to bed at night." created="Fri, 22 Jul 2016 17:23:49 GMT"/>
				<outline text="Despite all the steps I took with the Moto 360 to preserve battery life, I just couldn't count on it to make it through an entire day. Worse is that to extend battery life as long as possible I had to not use many of the features of the watch.&amp;nbsp;" created="Fri, 22 Jul 2016 17:23:50 GMT"/>
				<outline text="Since day one, my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gethuawei.com/huawei-watch&quot;&gt;Huawei Watch&lt;/a&gt;  screen has been configured to be always-on. I've used interactive watch faces and tracked my steps using the active Google Fit step tracker, and I have not had to worry about battery life. Not once has the watch gone dead.&amp;nbsp;" created="Fri, 22 Jul 2016 17:23:51 GMT"/>
				<outline text="In my opinion, if your smartwatch screen is not always-on, whether in an ambient mode or full power, you are not getting full value from the watch. For example, I had configured the Moto 360 to not display unless I press the crown, which eliminates the glance-ability of the watch. One of the reasons to wear a smartwatch is to quickly see information without having to use a smartphone, tablet, or computer.&amp;nbsp;" created="Fri, 22 Jul 2016 17:23:52 GMT"/>
				<outline text="While I am on the topic of the display, let me say that the AMOLED screen on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gethuawei.com/huawei-watch&quot;&gt;Huawei Watch&lt;/a&gt;  is gorgeous. The colors are vibrant and text is very legible.&amp;nbsp;" created="Fri, 22 Jul 2016 17:23:53 GMT"/>
				<outline text="The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gethuawei.com/huawei-watch&quot;&gt;Huawei Watch&lt;/a&gt;  seems thicker than the original Moto 360, but &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gsmarena.com/huawei_watch-7687.php&quot;&gt;according to GSM Arena it is in fact 2 mm thinner&lt;/a&gt;, and it has a smaller, 300 mAh battery compared to the 320 mAh battery in the Moto 360. I assumed the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gethuawei.com/huawei-watch&quot;&gt;Huawei Watch&lt;/a&gt;  had a larger battery, so I am surprised to learn it does not.&amp;nbsp;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMOLED&quot;&gt;AMOLED screen&lt;/a&gt; is a reason for the Huawei Watch's battery life because it consumes much less power than other screen display technology.&amp;nbsp;" created="Fri, 22 Jul 2016 17:23:54 GMT"/>
				<outline text="&lt;span&gt;Another problem I had with the Moto 360 is that it often lost connection with my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gsmarena.com/huawei_nexus_6p-7588.php&quot;&gt;Nexus 6P&lt;/a&gt;, and that might be a contributor to its poor battery life. I have not had similar problems with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gethuawei.com/huawei-watch&quot;&gt;Huawei Watch&lt;/a&gt;, it maintains connection with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gsmarena.com/huawei_nexus_6p-7588.php&quot;&gt;Nexus 6P&lt;/a&gt;  throughout the day. The Huawei Watch supports Bluetooth LE 4.1 while the original Moto 360 supports LE 4.0, so that might be a factor with the connectivity&amp;nbsp;difference.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;" created="Fri, 22 Jul 2016 17:23:55 GMT"/>
				<outline text="&lt;span&gt;Of course, a major difference between the two watches is that the Moto 360 is a first generation Android Wear watch, being one of the first ones sold starting in September 2014. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gethuawei.com/huawei-watch&quot;&gt;Huawei Watch&lt;/a&gt;  is a second generation Android Wear watch that became available in September 2015, so Huawei&amp;nbsp;benefited&amp;nbsp;from learning about the problems with the first generation&amp;nbsp;watches.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;" created="Fri, 22 Jul 2016 17:23:56 GMT"/>
				<outline text="&lt;span&gt;The key point here, I think, is that if you tried one of the first generation watches like the Moto 360 and were disappointed, I think it is worth checking out the newest watches as they are clearly better than the first ones. Given the discount price I payed for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gethuawei.com/huawei-watch&quot;&gt;Huawei Watch&lt;/a&gt;  I am very pleased with this purchase and I have a more favorable view of Android Wear.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;" created="Fri, 22 Jul 2016 17:23:57 GMT"/>

			<outline text="Replacing The Huawei Watch Band" created="Fri, 22 Jul 2016 18:10:09 GMT" type="outline">
				<outline text="When I bought the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gethuawei.com/huawei-watch&quot;&gt;Huawei Watch&lt;/a&gt;  I was unsure about its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01789KR2Q/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pd_S_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;colid=2OSYVCFR78X3K&amp;amp;coliid=I1RNQRNW6DQWHX&amp;amp;psc=1&quot;&gt;mesh band &lt;/a&gt;because most metal bands pull on the hair on my wrist and is therefore uncomfortable. At first I was surprised at how comfortable the mesh band felt, but I started to have two issues. One is that I don't find it easy to put the band on my wrist, and second is that it isn't easy to tighten the band to the point so that it doesn't move.  " created="Fri, 22 Jul 2016 18:10:10 GMT"/>
				<outline text="I ended up ordering a replacement band that arrived today. Replacing the band was easy thanks to Huawei's design that provides a quick release mechanism. The quick release mechanism makes it easy to swap watch bands without paying the high price for &lt;a href=&quot;https://store.google.com/category/mode_watch_bands&quot;&gt;the MODE bands&lt;/a&gt; Google sells. " created="Fri, 22 Jul 2016 18:10:11 GMT"/>
				<outline text="Huawei's bands are even more expensive than the MODE bands, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01789KR2Q/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pd_S_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;colid=2OSYVCFR78X3K&amp;amp;coliid=I1RNQRNW6DQWHX&amp;amp;psc=1&quot;&gt;the lowest price black leather band&lt;/a&gt; costing $54.99. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01789KR2Q/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pd_S_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;colid=2OSYVCFR78X3K&amp;amp;coliid=I1RNQRNW6DQWHX&amp;amp;psc=1&quot;&gt;The mesh band costs $129&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting that the band is about a third of the regular price of the watch! The black leather band that I bought on &lt;a href=&quot;http://Amazon.com&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-auto-link=&quot;true&quot; data-href=&quot;http://Amazon.com&quot;&gt;Amazon.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; cost $12.99 and is a nice, soft band. The same company that makes the leather band I bought also sells a mesh band for $18.99.&amp;nbsp;" created="Fri, 22 Jul 2016 18:10:12 GMT"/>

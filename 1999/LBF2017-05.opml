				<outline text="On Friday my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnet.com/products/huawei-watch/&quot;&gt;Huawei Watch&lt;/a&gt; was upgraded to Android Wear 2. Over all, I am pleased with the upgrade.

				<outline text="Some of the apps that I use are not yet optimized for the new notification model, particularly in my case Map My Walk.

Now, I have to swipe up to see the walking notification, tap the notification, then tap View Stats." created="Mon, 15 May 2017 15:29:47 GMT"/>

				<outline text="In my opinion, Assistant should be aware of all the devices that I use with my Google accounts, and I should be able to send information between devices.

				<outline text="The lack of integration across devices when it obviously should exist is a significant problem.

				<outline text="I hope that Google is going to make changes to Assistant that makes it more useful across Home, phone, and watch.

				<outline text="Yesterday we learned about the new phone from Andy Rubin's new company, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.essential.com/&quot;&gt;Essential&lt;/a&gt;. I expect much will be written about the new phone, but what I think is interesting is that Rubin's company appears to be trying to launch a new ecosystem in which the phone plays but a part." created="Thu, 01 Jun 2017 03:08:46 GMT"/>
				<outline text="The company is also developing a new software assistant, or what is now being called an &lt;a href=&quot;http://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/news/essential-phone-price-release-date-preorders-ambient-os-android-1706045&quot;&gt;Ambient OS&lt;/a&gt;. Like Google Assistant, Essential's will be available on their phone and in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/5/30/15711162/ambient-os-essential-home-andy-rubin&quot;&gt;an in-home appliance.&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;" created="Thu, 01 Jun 2017 03:08:47 GMT"/>
				<outline text="I am curious about why Rubin is choosing to develop their own assistant rather than use Google's, as they are doing in using Android. How can Essential have access to the same data as Google, and can they really write software better than Google?&amp;nbsp;" created="Thu, 01 Jun 2017 03:08:48 GMT"/>
				<outline text="The key might be in what Rubin said during The Verge's Recode conference, where he said that the problem Amazon's Echo and Google's Home is the UI. Essential might be developing a different interface that rides on top of Google Assistant, although The Verge says it is more akin to IFTTT.&amp;nbsp;" created="Thu, 01 Jun 2017 03:08:49 GMT"/>
				<outline text="What I am most excited by is his comments regarding IoT integration. He acknowledge the &quot;multiple hub&quot; problem of IoT that I've written of before and claims to be trying to provide a fix. If Essential's home appliance can eliminate the need for a Philips, SmartThings, and Harmony hub in my home, I will be a happy camper.&amp;nbsp;" created="Thu, 01 Jun 2017 03:08:50 GMT"/>
				<outline text="Rubin's past success in creating the HipTop and Android warrant taking him seriously, but he is claiming to do some bold things that might prove too difficult to overcome. Still, I am rooting for him!&amp;nbsp;" created="Thu, 01 Jun 2017 03:08:51 GMT"/>

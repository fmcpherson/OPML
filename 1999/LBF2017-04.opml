				<outline text="I've been running GalliumOS on my Acer C720 for a few days now, and I am really enjoying the experience. One problem that I did uncover is the lack of Page Up and Page Down keys.&amp;nbsp;" created="Thu, 13 Apr 2017 01:37:45 GMT"/>
				<outline text="Part of the problem is caused by the C720 being designed to be a Chromebook because its keyboard does not have dedicated Page Up and Page Down keys. Nor does it have Home and End keys.&amp;nbsp;" created="Thu, 13 Apr 2017 01:37:46 GMT"/>
				<outline text="ChromeOS provides keyboard shortcuts as replacements, Right Alt + the Up arrow for Page Up, Right Alt + the down arrow for Page Down. However, despite the fact that GalliumOS has a keyboard mapper with a default setting for Chromebooks, the settings don't work.&amp;nbsp;" created="Thu, 13 Apr 2017 01:37:47 GMT"/>
				<outline text="Fortunately, I have found a fix to the problem that involves running &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fascinatingcaptain.com/blog/automate-chromebook-fixes-for-linux/&quot;&gt;a set of commands found on this page&lt;/a&gt;. The fix does &amp;nbsp;not enable the Right Alt as the overlay key, but I have found that I can enable the Search key (which is placed where one normally finds Caps Lock) and that works just fine for me. I am just happy to get Page Up and Down back!&amp;nbsp;" created="Thu, 13 Apr 2017 01:37:48 GMT"/>

				<outline text="If you browse &lt;a href=&quot;https://browser.geekbench.com/user/120423&quot;&gt;my Geekbench profile&lt;/a&gt; you will quickly notice that I do not use what most will consider to be high-end computers. The best rated computer is my old work computer (a ProBook 6460b) that I got more than six years ago. Unfortunately my new work computer, an EliteBook 745 G3, is much slower than the computer it replaces, although it is much thinner and lighter." created="Thu, 13 Apr 2017 02:04:14 GMT"/>
				<outline text="I've become re-acquainted with the Acer C720 through my experimentation with &lt;a href=&quot;https://galliumos.org/&quot;&gt;GalliumOS&lt;/a&gt;, and I am surprised to find to be as fast as newer computers that I own.&amp;nbsp;" created="Thu, 13 Apr 2017 02:04:15 GMT"/>
				<outline text="Looking back at when I ordered the Acer, it only cost me $100 after using reward points, and that has turned out to be a really good purchase. Even at the $249 full retain price, it would have been well worth the price.&amp;nbsp;" created="Thu, 13 Apr 2017 02:04:16 GMT"/>
				<outline text="Putting a Linux distro on the C720 makes it even more useful than it was running ChromeOS. I get all the ChromeOS functionality via Chromium and gain the ability to run Linux UI and command line apps. I've installed Nodejs to run River5 and I've installed Docker and pulled containers." created="Thu, 13 Apr 2017 02:04:17 GMT"/>
				<outline text="One big constraint is the limited disk space, the Acer C720 only has 16 GB of storage. I have found that you can replace that 16 GB SSD with a pretty inexpensive 128 GB SSD that I ordered from Newegg for $44.&amp;nbsp;" created="Thu, 13 Apr 2017 02:04:18 GMT"/>
				<outline text="I've found &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jOHHyJMgWk&quot;&gt;installation instructions for replacing the SSD&lt;/a&gt;, it looks like the biggest challenge will be prying the back cover off after removing all the screws. Cracking open the case will void the warranty, but again, I only paid $100 for this thing!&amp;nbsp;" created="Thu, 13 Apr 2017 02:04:19 GMT"/>

				<outline text="Microsoft has revealed what it is doing with Wunderlist, it is replacing it with something they are calling &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.office.com/2017/04/19/introducing-microsoft-to-do-now-available-in-preview/&quot;&gt;Microsoft To-Do&lt;/a&gt;.

				<outline text="I don't understand why Microsoft needs to replace Wunderlist, I guess they found it too difficult to integrate with Office 365.

				<outline text="Historically, To-Do list functionality has always been a gap for Microsoft. For example, the Outlook Android and iOS apps do not have a to-do list even though it exists in Outlook and Exchange.&amp;nbsp;" created="Wed, 19 Apr 2017 17:36:18 GMT"/>

				<outline text="I have several &lt;a href=&quot;http://www2.meethue.com/en-us/&quot;&gt;Hue &quot;smart&quot; light bulbs&lt;/a&gt; in my home. One thing that frustrates me about how they work is that they don't behave like regular light bulbs when there is a power outage." created="Fri, 28 Apr 2017 20:33:19 GMT"/>
				<outline text="With a non-smart lamp, you physically turn a light on and off, so if you have the lamp off and there is a power outage, the light will not just turn on when power is restored. The same cannot be said about smart lights like Hue, instead they turn on to max brightness the instant power is restored." created="Fri, 28 Apr 2017 20:33:20 GMT"/>
				<outline text="Imagine having one of these lights in your bed room and being woken in the middle of the night.&amp;nbsp;" created="Fri, 28 Apr 2017 20:33:21 GMT"/>
				<outline text="The problem is that the on/off state of the light bulb is controlled by either a hub or the bulb itself. Yet, you are putting these bulbs in normal lamps with a physical switch. The manufacturers are concerned that in an emergency, if one where to try the turn on the light after a power outage by using the lamp's switch, they would not be able to do so." created="Fri, 28 Apr 2017 20:33:22 GMT"/>
				<outline text="I personally don't understand this safety concern, because not responding to the lamp's switch is actually how the light normally works. If a Hue light is off and you flip the switch on the lamp and flip it again, nothing happens, the light does not turn on. So, under normal circumstances the safety concern manufacturers claim to preventing against is in fact the default condition.&amp;nbsp;" created="Fri, 28 Apr 2017 20:33:23 GMT"/>
				<outline text="So, I think smart bulb manufactures should give users the control over deciding the default state after a sudden disruption of power. &amp;nbsp;In the bedroom, I want to configure the bulb to default to off and stay off until I manually go into the app and turn it back on.&amp;nbsp;" created="Fri, 28 Apr 2017 20:33:24 GMT"/>

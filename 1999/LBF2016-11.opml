The song is cheerful and easy to sing along, but while it captures the fun of Wrigley after a victory, it doesn't truly capture the essence of being a Cubs fan." created="Thu, 03 Nov 2016 18:27:05 GMT"/>
				<outline text="Goodman also penned &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xBxZGQ1dJk&quot;&gt;A Dying Cubs Fan's Last Request&lt;/a&gt;&quot; that to me more accurately captures what it means to be a Cubs fan.

				<outline text="It is going to take many days for the reality that Donald Trump will be front and center in our lives for four years to sink in. The immediate aftermath will be the punditry on why Trump has been elected.&amp;nbsp;" created="Wed, 09 Nov 2016 13:56:20 GMT"/>
				<outline text="I hoped this wouldn't happen, but deep down in the pit of my stomach I knew it would happen. One place to look to why this happened are the favorability ratings of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.politico.com/story/2015/08/poll-congress-approval-rating-gop-leadership-121285&quot;&gt;Congress&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;" created="Wed, 09 Nov 2016 13:56:21 GMT"/>
				<outline text="The ratings show that many people think our representatives do a bad job. When they looked at Trump, they probably think, he can't be any worse than what we already have, so why not try something different?" created="Wed, 09 Nov 2016 13:56:22 GMT"/>
				<outline text="Obviously, this same analysis took place in comparing Clinton and Trump. Many people feel &lt;a href=&quot;http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americans-distaste-for-both-trump-and-clinton-is-record-breaking/&quot;&gt;they are equally bad&lt;/a&gt;. When selecting between two bad options, they chose the different option, or the devil you don't know versus the devil you do know." created="Wed, 09 Nov 2016 13:56:23 GMT"/>
				<outline text="In the advertising I saw here in Michigan, the ads from Trump and Clinton made these options very clear. Trump's ads positioned him as the outsider and a vote for him is a vote for change, Clinton's ads positioned her as the safe, known, reliable, and translated by many as non-change, option." created="Wed, 09 Nov 2016 13:56:24 GMT"/>
				<outline text="So, to me, the main message of Trump's election is that nearly half country wants change, no matter what. I am pretty sure not everyone agrees with all the changes Trump proposed during his campaign, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/10/us/politics/donald-trump-presidential-agenda.html?smid=tw-nytpolitics&amp;amp;smtyp=cur&quot;&gt;I bet many people hope many were empty promises&lt;/a&gt;, but they don't care!&amp;nbsp;" created="Wed, 09 Nov 2016 13:56:25 GMT"/>
				<outline text="No one can dispute that Trump is very different from any person we elected President. What I will dispute, and which I fear not enough people have fully considered, is that the consequences of that difference could really be worse than what is already in place.&amp;nbsp;" created="Wed, 09 Nov 2016 13:56:26 GMT"/>

				<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;https://store.google.com/product/pixel_phone&quot;&gt;The Pixel phone&lt;/a&gt; looks good, but so far I haven't seen anything that makes me want to dump my Nexus 6P. I wonder whether Google Assistant will replace Google Now on existing Android phones? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theverge.com/a/google-pixel-phone-new-hardware-interview-2016&quot;&gt;The Verge says&lt;/a&gt; it is not replacing Google Now on Nexus any time soon. I guess Google is starting to act like typical hardware companies that hold back features to push one to upgrade.&amp;nbsp;" created="Tue, 04 Oct 2016 17:13:22 GMT"/>
				<outline text="For me the biggest issue with the Pixel phones is the price, $649 as the starting price of the 5-inch model and there is a $120 price increase for the 5.5-inch model, for a $769 total. This is much higher than the Nexus market has been paying. Is Google Assistant worth the price premium? Is the camera really good enough to justify the higher price? Pre-order now, ships October 20.&amp;nbsp;" created="Tue, 04 Oct 2016 17:13:23 GMT"/>
				<outline text="Google is still working on WiFi routers. The new hotness in WiFi is multiple access points to improve coverage in a home, which is an approach that has existed forever in enterprise implementations. As I see it, the biggest selling point of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://store.google.com/product/google_wifi&quot;&gt;Google's new router &lt;/a&gt;is the lower price to implement multiple access points." created="Tue, 04 Oct 2016 17:13:24 GMT"/>
				<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;https://store.google.com/product/google_home&quot;&gt;Google Home&lt;/a&gt; looks cool, but I already own an Amazon Echo and have a Dot ordered, so I am not sure I am willing to switch from that investment. I do like Google Home's integration with Chromecast. Design for multiple devices. $129 price is good, pre-order today, shipping on November 4.&amp;nbsp;" created="Tue, 04 Oct 2016 17:13:25 GMT"/>
				<outline text="What would be really, really cool is if Echo could control Chromecast. Here in lies the single biggest problem with IoT, it is all about lock in. I have three different IoT hubs (Hue Bridge, SmartThings, and Logitech Harmony) while there should be one &quot;generic&quot; hub that can control multiple brands of devices." created="Tue, 04 Oct 2016 17:13:26 GMT"/>

				<outline text="I fear Google Home may be too late. People who have bought in to smart homes have likely already invested in Echo, and the size of the &quot;intelligent assistant appliance&quot; market is a big unknown. A great number of people are not comfortable with an always on, always listening device in their home.&amp;nbsp;" created="Tue, 04 Oct 2016 17:13:28 GMT"/>
				<outline text="Of the hardware devices Google announced, the one with the most appeal is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://store.google.com/product/chromecast_ultra&quot;&gt;Chromecast Ultra&lt;/a&gt;. But here too, there is the problem that I already have a Chromecast on all the TVs and a monitor in my house.

				<outline text="My hope was that Google would be able to influence the market towards lower priced, high quality devices, and for me that was what Nexus was about.

I don't see how this is good for users.&amp;nbsp;" created="Wed, 05 Oct 2016 19:08:23 GMT"/>
				<outline text="What really troubles me is the idea that by this Google has really put a price premium on being able to buy and maintain the latest version of Android in a smartphone.

				<outline text="If you set up a Raspberry Pi as a server on your home network you may want to configure DHCP on your home network so that the same IP address is assigned to it every time the computer is booted.

				<outline text="In &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/20/technology/whoever-wins-the-white-house-this-years-big-loser-is-email.html?partner=IFTTT&amp;amp;_r=1&quot;&gt;a recent article for the New York Times&lt;/a&gt;, Farhad Manjoo makes a good point about email, it's broken. Yet, email is the most commonly used and therefore most important communication tool because it is not app-specific. One can use a number of different apps to access email, and more importantly, the person with whom you exchange email does not need to use the same app as you, and this is a fundamental difference between all the other services except for SMS text messaging.&amp;nbsp;" created="Wed, 19 Oct 2016 19:37:27 GMT"/>
				<outline text="In most cases to use Slack, WhatsApp, Skype, or Facebook Messenger, all parties involved in the communication have to use those same apps and that is a big hurdle. It is why Facebook is firmly entrenched, enough of your friends are there to keep you using it despite how much you hate it." created="Wed, 19 Oct 2016 19:37:28 GMT"/>
				<outline text="In other words, for something to replace email it has to be a server-based solution open for access to a wide range of different apps to increase the probability a person's app of choice works. Unfortunately, technology is much more siloed today than ever before and consequently email will remain one of the sole common denominators. (If Apple were serious about iMessage, it would have gone ahead and made it open to work with other apps on other platforms, or at least created an Android version of iMessage. Instead, Apple treats iMessage as a carrot to lure more people to iOS, which means iMessage has no chance of replacing email.)&amp;nbsp;" created="Wed, 19 Oct 2016 19:37:29 GMT"/>
				<outline text="Thus, we are left with email and therefore any hope for improving email lies in alternative email apps rather than replacing email &quot;the service.&quot; We are starting to see apps adding AI and other features that hopefully make it easier to quickly review and process email. &amp;nbsp;" created="Wed, 19 Oct 2016 19:37:30 GMT"/>
				<outline text="I find myself to be in the minority in liking &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/inbox/&quot;&gt;Google's Inbox app&lt;/a&gt;, most people stick with the &quot;standard&quot; Gmail. I like how Inbox bundles emails and provides a quick way for me to scan and archive them as a bundle rather than individually, which enables me to process email faster. Google also recently added a suggested replies feature that speeds up sending replies to messages." created="Wed, 19 Oct 2016 19:37:31 GMT"/>

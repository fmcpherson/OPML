				<outline text="I’ve been noodling over how to write Nodejs code on my iPad Pro. To make it work I need two main parts, an editor and the ability to run node. I haven’t found a way to run node on the iPad, so I need an intermediary, which can be a Linux server. " created="Sat, 05 Aug 2017 20:30:27 GMT"/>
				<outline text="For now I am using the remaining Ubuntu server I have running on CloudAtCost and I am accessing it via SSH using Termius. &lt;a href=&quot;https://appsto.re/us/K8AUG.i&quot;&gt;Termius&lt;/a&gt; works good enough, but I am finding a quirk in which text at the very bottom of the screen doesn’t scroll up automatically. I can clear the screen and then slide up using my finger, but this is inconvenient." created="Sat, 05 Aug 2017 20:30:28 GMT"/>
				<outline text="While I could just use vim or nano to write code, I rather use an app on the iPad, which means I need a way to get what I write from the iPad to the server. GitHub is the logical choice as it provides a repository that I can then clone to any other server, which is important because the server at CloudAtCost is not reliable. " created="Sat, 05 Aug 2017 20:30:29 GMT"/>
				<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;https://appsto.re/us/xONC1.i&quot;&gt;Working Copy&lt;/a&gt; is a highly rated Git app for the iPad, so I went and bought a copy of it, but I still needed an editor. After a little research I bought &lt;a href=&quot;https://appsto.re/us/Kmz9D.i&quot;&gt;Buffer&lt;/a&gt;, which I found has built-in support for Github so it turns out I might not have needed to buy Working Copy. Buffer in fact handles commit and push in the background, all you do is Save any changes that I make." created="Sat, 05 Aug 2017 20:30:30 GMT"/>
				<outline text="So, I have ended up with a workflow where I can write and edit code in Buffer, save it to my repository on Github, toggle over to Termius, login to my Ubuntu server, do a git pull to update the cloned copy of the repository and then execute and test the code.

				<outline text="          " created="Sat, 05 Aug 2017 20:30:32 GMT"/>
				<outline text="The workflow requires an Internet connection in order to run and test what I write, but that is a pretty negligible issue that I can manage. I think an ideal solution would be a container that I could run on the iPad, but which had a full access to Linux command line tools.&amp;nbsp;" created="Sat, 05 Aug 2017 20:30:33 GMT"/>

				<outline text="Actually, racism isn't the right word. The real problem is egoism, or supremacy, or whatever it is that drives one to live their lives as though they are better than anyone else.

				<outline text="The opposite to egoism is empathy, which is simply the act of taking into consideration someone other than yourself.

				<outline text="The second change is that the United States is becoming more diverse, removing the power that comes with the higher population of a particular race. Further, the millennials growing up in our more diverse society not only question the validity of white supremacy but also acknowledge the pain their symbols represent. In other words, the main change is that the number of people who consider the symbols to be offensive has increased and the growing minority of the people who not only don't find them offensive but also nearly worship them, absent their ability to get their way via the democratic process, are fighting back.&amp;nbsp;" created="Fri, 18 Aug 2017 14:58:35 GMT"/>

Most modern browsers provide a way to sync bookmarks across devices, so I am not sure of the value of a separate bookmarking app. It does remove dependency on a browser.

				<outline text="While the Cubs did win the NL Central this year and have made it to the League Championship Series, they are not playing as good as they did last year.

				<outline text="The real problem is that the Cubs are not hitting. Tonight is game three of the series and the first game of the series at Wrigley Field.

				<outline text="On July 25, 2016 &lt;a href=&quot;http://m.mlb.com/news/article/191611658/cubs-acquire-aroldis-chapman-from-yankees/&quot;&gt;the Chicago Cubs acquired Aroldis Chapman in a trade&lt;/a&gt; with the New York Yankees. The trade for Chapman proved to be the pinnacle moment for the Cubs’s quest to play in the 2016 World Series and ultimately become World Champions.  " created="Fri, 20 Oct 2017 19:24:40 GMT"/>
				<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://writing.frankmcpherson.org/2016/11/03/chapmanIsMyWorldSeriesMvp.html&quot;&gt;In my opinion&lt;/a&gt; Chapman was the the World Series MVP. The shutdown inning he pitched in the bottom of the nineth inning after giving up the game tying home run in the eighth inning was incredible when you consider the emotions of blowing the save that would have won the championship. Without the shutdown inning Zobrist would not have the opportunity to make the big game winning hit.  " created="Fri, 20 Oct 2017 19:24:41 GMT"/>
				<outline text="Now, a day after the Cubs have lost to Dodgers in the 2017 National League Championship Series, you can more clearly see the importance of that trade in July, 2016. Even though Chapman was a rental, the Cubs did not really pursue signing him, he was definitely the final piece of the puzzle of a surprising 2016 season.   " created="Fri, 20 Oct 2017 19:24:42 GMT"/>
				<outline text="The Chicago Cubs went in to 2016 having lost in the 2015 League Championship series with expectations of another division championship, but doubts of whether the team had matured enough to make a first appearance in the World Series in more than 100 years.   " created="Fri, 20 Oct 2017 19:24:43 GMT"/>
				<outline text="The biggest question was what impact Kris Bryant’s pending call up from the minors would have on the team. Everyone new Bryant was good, but nobody expected him to be named league MVP in his rookie season.   " created="Fri, 20 Oct 2017 19:24:44 GMT"/>
				<outline text="2016 was not expected to be the year for the Cub’s first World Series appearance, most thought 2017, this year, would be that year. Yet still, the Cubs exceeded expectations, and by July of 2016 Cubs management rightly recognized the timeline had accelerated and they had to seize the moment.   " created="Fri, 20 Oct 2017 19:24:45 GMT"/>
				<outline text="In other words, what we have learned this year is how the opportunities for championships rarely go as planned and the importance for seizing the moment when it arrives. To state what may be obvious, changes made between seasons impact the upcoming season’s performance, but mid-season changes make or break post-season performance.   " created="Fri, 20 Oct 2017 19:24:46 GMT"/>
				<outline text="&lt;span style=&quot;-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;&quot;&gt;How much more crushing would the defeat last night had been if Jed and Theo had not made that trade for Chapman? So, while last year I proclaimed Chapman my 2016 World Series MVP, in hindsight that award really belonged to the front office.&lt;/span&gt;" created="Fri, 20 Oct 2017 19:24:47 GMT"/>

				<outline text="Connoisseurs of American sports consider football to be the ultimate team sport because no one player can directly impact the outcome of a game. Even the best quarterback cannot succeed if there is not a good offensive line blocking to provide time to throw the ball and receivers capable of catching the ball. A good offense can score lots of points but if the defense does not prevent the opposing team from scoring, the team can still lose the game.   " created="Fri, 20 Oct 2017 19:48:56 GMT"/>

We also learned how difficult it is for aebaseball team to repeat its prior year performance.  " created="Fri, 20 Oct 2017 19:48:57 GMT"/>
				<outline text="The final analysis of the Cub’s play during the League Championship series will likely &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/baseball/cubs/ct-cubs-postseason-offense-2017-htmlstory.html&quot;&gt;point the finger at their anemic hitting&lt;/a&gt;. What might be overlooked is how their poor bullpen affected the hitting and how the poor hitting affected starting pitching.   " created="Fri, 20 Oct 2017 19:48:58 GMT"/>
				<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sbnation.com/2017/10/16/16480920/cubs-dodgers-nlcs-bullpen-lackey-wade-davis-maddon&quot;&gt;The poor Cubs bullpen&lt;/a&gt;, exacerbated more by the Dodger’s excellent bullpen, shortened the game. Cubs hitters knew they had to hit and score runs in the early innings to have a chance to win. Success in baseball comes primarily in how the players handle pressure.   " created="Fri, 20 Oct 2017 19:48:59 GMT"/>
				<outline text="Pressure on the hitters causes them to do things they otherwise don’t, and that provides a huge advantage to opposing pitchers.   " created="Fri, 20 Oct 2017 19:49:00 GMT"/>
				<outline text="Cub’s starting pitching went into the games thinking they had to pitch a shutout to win because they weren’t getting any run support. Further, the starting pitchers knew the bullpen was not doing their job and therefore felt they not only had to pitch a shutout, but do so for at least six, if not seven, innings.   " created="Fri, 20 Oct 2017 19:49:01 GMT"/>
				<outline text="Pressure on pitchers tends to cause them to not throw through the ball where they want, resulting in walks or lots of hits and home runs. Cubs pitching gave up too much of all these in this series.  " created="Fri, 20 Oct 2017 19:49:02 GMT"/>
				<outline text="In contrast, Dodger hitters had no pressure to do anything more than they did all season. Relaxed hitters can do unexpected things like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sportingnews.com/mlb/news/world-series-2017-enrique-hernandez-kike-puerto-rico-three-home-runs-dad-father-hurricane-nlcs/y60xy0n99km81s6oo70v9fd3y&quot;&gt;Enrique Hernandez’s three home runs&lt;/a&gt; last night. Dodger pitching enabled the hitters to relax and their bullpen and hitting enabled the starting pitching to not have to worry if they gave up runs early in the game, hitting and relieving always gave the Dodgers a chance to win.   " created="Fri, 20 Oct 2017 19:49:03 GMT"/>
				<outline text="&lt;span style=&quot;-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;&quot;&gt;In other words, even though an individual pitcher or hitter can influence the outcome of a game, baseball is still very much a team sport and a balanced team is necessary for winning championships. The 2017 National League Championship Series proved the Los Angelas Dodgers to be the better team than the Chicago Cubs, and that is why they are playing in the World Series.&lt;/span&gt;" created="Fri, 20 Oct 2017 19:49:04 GMT"/>

I own, and use, a 2-in-1, the Surface 3, but I hardly use the keyboard, I mostly use the Surface as a tablet and write in OneNote using the Surface Pen. Consequently, I think I am the target audience for the 10.5-inch iPad Pro with Pencil, and that is why I will most likely buy one. The one thing the Surface 3 has that I will miss with the iPad Pro is the built-in kick stand. Otherwise, I expect that I will be able to write in OneNote using the Pencil as I do with the Surface 3.&nbsp;",

Teams that make it to the World Series are penalized the next year by forcing their pitchers to play too many games. MLB ought to think about whether it is smarter to cut back on some ticket sales for the sake of having a higher chance of repeating success on a yearly basis. In my opinion, the World Series should not be played in November!&nbsp;",

Thoughtlessly yell ‘stupid!’ at a sister and you are on the brink of hellfire. The simple moral fact is that words kill. - Matthew 5:21–22, The Message  " created="Sun, 05 Nov 2017 20:32:55 GMT"/>

				<outline text="The 2016 Democratic Party primary only looks rigged to those who either don't know or don't want to admit how party politics works. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/11/14/16640082/donna-brazile-warren-bernie-sanders-democratic-primary-rigged&quot;&gt;Vox has a good article&lt;/a&gt; summarizing how the party coalesced around Clinton and how her path to nomination was cleared, and there is nothing abnormal about it.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;" created="Tue, 14 Nov 2017 16:10:26 GMT"/>
				<outline text="Vox concludes that there should have been more candidates in the Democratic primary, but I think that is convenient thinking that overlooks primary history. Jimmy Carter's re-election bid was thwarted part by a internal party struggle between he and Ted Kennedy. It is generally believed that a party should quickly fall in to line behind an incumbent president seeking re-election because that demonstrates unity and more importantly consolidates money.&amp;nbsp;" created="Tue, 14 Nov 2017 16:10:27 GMT"/>
				<outline text="Another important point that Bernie supporters refuse to accept is that he is not a Democrat. Two people attempted to hijack party nominations, one succeeded and became president while the other failed against a long-time Democrat. I just don't understand why anyone would think the Democrat elites, who really run the party, would ever blindly accept Bernie with open arms.&amp;nbsp;" created="Tue, 14 Nov 2017 16:10:28 GMT"/>
				<outline text="Those with a beef with the fact that Bernie didn't get a &quot;fair shot&quot; really have a beef with our overall political party process, and that is not really just a Democrat or Republican thing.&amp;nbsp;" created="Tue, 14 Nov 2017 16:10:29 GMT"/>

				<outline text="I've been using the Pixel 2 for a couple weeks now, enough time to get a feel for battery life. I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.digibites.accubattery&amp;amp;hl=en&quot;&gt;AccuBattery Pro&lt;/a&gt; to monitor battery life, particularly paying attention to the percentage of screen off time in deep sleep and correspondingly the percentage decrease in battery while the screen is off.&amp;nbsp;" created="Fri, 17 Nov 2017 18:35:00 GMT"/>
				<outline text="Generally, I am finding battery life on the Pixel 2 to be no better or worse than the Nexus 6P. When all is right I see nearly 75% of screen of time in deep sleep and about 1.5% battery decrease while the screen is off. AccuBattery estimates 5h 18m of screen on time, 36h 22m of screen off time, and 25h 39m of combined use time.&amp;nbsp; All these numbers align to my use case." created="Fri, 17 Nov 2017 18:35:01 GMT"/>
				<outline text="I have found that for some reason Google's automatic wallpaper change prevents the phone from going in to deep sleep and therefore battery consumption jumps to around 5% of screen off time. Consequently, I don't let Android automatically change the wallpaper. Clearly there is some bad programming with that feature because I don't understand why such a thing should prevent the phone from going into deep sleep. In fact, I thought Android O came with a feature that better managed such bad behavior by forcing apps to allow deep sleep.&amp;nbsp;" created="Fri, 17 Nov 2017 18:35:02 GMT"/>

				<outline text="If anyone who reads this blog can help me, I would like to figure out how to center the body of this site when it is rendered in portrait orientation on iOS devices. Right now when you load this page in portrait the left side of the middle portion of this page aligns to the FrankNet drop down menu, but when you rotate the device to landscape view the left side shifts left, lining up basically under the &quot;r&quot; of the &quot;Let's Be Frank&quot; at the top of the display.

I own, and use, a 2-in-1, the Surface 3, but I hardly use the keyboard, I mostly use the Surface as a tablet and write in OneNote using the Surface Pen. Consequently, I think I am the target audience for the 10.5-inch iPad Pro with Pencil, and that is why I will most likely buy one. The one thing the Surface 3 has that I will miss with the iPad Pro is the built-in kick stand. Otherwise, I expect that I will be able to write in OneNote using the Pencil as I do with the Surface 3.&amp;nbsp;" created="Wed, 14 Jun 2017 17:11:03 GMT"/>

				<outline text="Last night I installed the public beta of iOS 11 on my iPad Pro and I am happy that I did. First off, one of my main beefs with iOS has been addressed, which is the wiggling and running icons that appear when you move items on the home screens. No more frustrating chasing icons, the only icon that moves is the one you want to move!" created="Tue, 27 Jun 2017 16:01:45 GMT"/>
				<outline text="I also love the new dock, and I've tried the new multitasking features but it is not obvious to me how one closes an overlayed app, it looks like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnet.com/uk/how-to/tips-and-tricks-for-ipad-on-ios-11/&quot;&gt;you just swipe it right&lt;/a&gt; and it remains forever docked until you overlay a different app. In practice, I mostly use Lastpass in this swip-over, overlay mode." created="Tue, 27 Jun 2017 16:01:46 GMT"/>
				<outline text="You can also configure apps to work side-by-side but I have found that certain apps do not work in this way, in particular Google Inbox appears to not allow side-by-side. My first use of this side-by-side is with Outlook and Todoist, with Outlook using about two thirds of the screen." created="Tue, 27 Jun 2017 16:01:47 GMT"/>
				<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/28/15885400/ios-11-ipad-gestures-laptop-features&quot;&gt;The argument&lt;/a&gt; about whether an iPad Pro running iOS 11 can replace a laptop to me is pointless because it comes down to motivation. People who want to use an iPad Pro as their only computer will find a way to do it, people who are biased against the idea will point out &lt;a href=&quot;https://apple.slashdot.org/story/17/06/27/1516241/the-new-ipad-pro-review&quot;&gt;the many ways in which the iPad Pro falls short&lt;/a&gt;. The reality, this scenario has always been the case ever since the first iPad was announced and you could make external keyboards work with it. Right now, I think the main question in this argument is, can you live without a mouse and use touch or stylus for precision movement? &amp;nbsp;" created="Tue, 27 Jun 2017 16:01:48 GMT"/>

				<outline text="Last year I asked, &lt;a href=&quot;http://writing.frankmcpherson.org/2016/06/26/0090.html&quot;&gt;Does the Surface 3 have a successor&lt;/a&gt;? A year later, it doesn't appear as though it does from Microsoft, nor does it look like it will. I might have moved on to the iPad Pro 10.5 inch, since I bought it the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/products/surface-3&quot;&gt;Surface 3&lt;/a&gt; has barely left its cradle.&amp;nbsp;" created="Fri, 30 Jun 2017 15:08:29 GMT"/>
				<outline text="Earlier this week &lt;a href=&quot;https://fjmnotes.com/2017/06/28/hope-they-let-me-out/&quot;&gt;I went to the Detroit Zoo&lt;/a&gt;. They did let me out.&amp;nbsp;" created="Fri, 30 Jun 2017 15:08:30 GMT"/>
				<outline text="I have a degree in computer science and was taught functional programming. Functional programming is a methodology of breaking a large problem down into smaller parts, which is an approach I naturally apply and why I like &lt;a href=&quot;http://fargo.io/docs/outlinerHowto.html&quot;&gt;outlines&lt;/a&gt;. The challenge is finding a tool built from the ground up to make and manipulate outlines. I like using Little Outliner in a web browser, but that doesn't work well on my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apple.com/ipad-pro/&quot;&gt;iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt; so on it I am using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.omnigroup.com/omnioutliner/ios&quot;&gt;OmniOutliner&lt;/a&gt;. I wish a version of OmniOutliner were available for Windows. I could live with a copy of Electric Outline." created="Fri, 30 Jun 2017 15:08:31 GMT"/>
				<outline text="Some people like creating &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mindmapping.com/&quot;&gt;mind maps&lt;/a&gt;, which I consider to be a graphical outliner. I've used mind maps over the years, but find the graphics to slow me down. I guess I just think hierarchically.&amp;nbsp;" created="Fri, 30 Jun 2017 15:08:32 GMT"/>
				<outline text="I am still &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=best+cases+for+the+ipad+pro+10.5&quot;&gt;looking a case&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apple.com/ipad-pro/&quot;&gt;iPad Pro 10.5 inch&lt;/a&gt;. The thing is, I am leaning towards a sleeve given that when I am at home I really prefer using the iPad naked. I bought a cheap Moko case to attend a seminar last weekend, but doesn't have a pencil holder, which is another requirement. Right now I am leaning towards &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sfbags.com/collections/ipad-pro-sleeves-and-bags/products/ipad-sleevecase&quot;&gt;the iPad Pro SleeveCase from Waterfield&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;" created="Fri, 30 Jun 2017 15:08:33 GMT"/>
				<outline text="I was planning to by the Logitech Slim Combo keyboard case but the reviews have turned me off. The Apple keyboard case doesn't sound too much better, but I have read that the Apple Magic Keyboard and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.studioneat.com/products/canopy&quot;&gt;Canopy case&lt;/a&gt; make a great combo.&amp;nbsp;" created="Fri, 30 Jun 2017 15:08:34 GMT"/>

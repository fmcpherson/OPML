				<outline text="I have the day off today, and I have spent the day doing the two things I enjoy doing the most: reading and writing. First, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25359165-the-real-paul&quot;&gt;I finished a book&lt;/a&gt; while enjoying the relatively cool morning on the patio. After lunch I headed to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.novicoffee.com/&quot;&gt;one of my favorite coffee shops&lt;/a&gt; and did some writing. If I were retired, I imagine this is how I would spend most of my days.  " created="Mon, 03 Jul 2017 19:55:40 GMT"/>
				<outline text="Today is the first day that I have used the iPad Pro to write while away from my home office. My writing workflow using the Pro is coming together. Physically, I will use the Apple Magic keyboard with a Canopy case, while using either &lt;a href=&quot;http://agiletortoise.com/drafts/&quot;&gt;Drafts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.omnigroup.com/omnioutliner/&quot;&gt;OmniOutliner&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://ulyssesapp.com/&quot;&gt;Ulysses&lt;/a&gt;.   " created="Mon, 03 Jul 2017 19:55:41 GMT"/>
				<outline text="After considering whether to buy a keyboard case, I decided against it in favor of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://store.apple.com/xc/product/MLA22LL/A&quot;&gt;Apple Magic keyboard&lt;/a&gt;, which I am using to write this post. I don’t plan to always use a case with the iPad and a small but functional keyboard is just as useful to me, perhaps more so, than a keyboard case that I would be taking off most of the time anyway.   " created="Mon, 03 Jul 2017 19:55:42 GMT"/>
				<outline text="I have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.studioneat.com/products/canopy&quot;&gt;Canopy case&lt;/a&gt; on order for the keyboard, and I think it will work well for carrying it around. The keyboard just fits inside my &lt;a href=&quot;http://the-gadgeteer.com/2013/08/03/waterfield-design-indy-bag-review/&quot;&gt;Waterfield Indie bag&lt;/a&gt;, so I am a little worried whether it will fit when in the Canopy case, but make do if it does not.   " created="Mon, 03 Jul 2017 19:55:43 GMT"/>
				<outline text="Right now an using a cheap Moko case for the Pro, and the case does hold iPad in a good typing position, but one of the benefits of the Canopy case is that it also acts as a stand so plan to use a sleeve for the iPad once the one I ordered arrives.

				<outline text="I am still learning how to best use the apps that I have chosen for writing with the iPad Pro. The first step is determining the best way to write blog posts for this blog." created="Mon, 03 Jul 2017 21:17:11 GMT"/>
				<outline text="I use &lt;a href=&quot;http://1999.io/&quot;&gt;1999.io&lt;/a&gt; for writing and publishing content here, but its browser based rich text editor is designed for desktops and doesn’t work well in mobile browsers. " created="Mon, 03 Jul 2017 21:17:12 GMT"/>
				<outline text="The main problem is with linking, which I think is fundamental to blogging. To &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.1999.io/2016/06/01/0028.html&quot;&gt;link to a web page in 1999&lt;/a&gt; on a desktop all you do is select the word or words you want to be the anchor and a pop-up menu automatically displays with the option for creating a link. The equivalent on a mobile browser is tap and hold, but the default iOS action menu appears rather than the menu 1999 normally displays. " created="Mon, 03 Jul 2017 21:17:13 GMT"/>
				<outline text="My solution is to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://agiletortoise.com/drafts/&quot;&gt;Drafts&lt;/a&gt; along with a HTML source editor plugin for 1999. First, I write the blog post, along with any included hyperlinks in Drafts, which is a markdown editor. Ideally for me 1999 would have a markdown editor, at least as a plugin, but it does not, so my next step is to convert the markdown post in Drafts to HTML, and then copy the entire post to the clipboard. " created="Mon, 03 Jul 2017 21:17:14 GMT"/>
				<outline text="Next, I have to switch to Safari. I have discovered that for some reason the input box of the HTML source editor in Chrome does not have access to the clipboard, so I have to use Safari. " created="Mon, 03 Jul 2017 21:17:15 GMT"/>
				<outline text="I create or select the blog post, select the HTML source editor in the Editors menu, paste the contents of the clipboard in to the input box, and then tap Update to save my writing. &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update:&lt;/b&gt; I have found the above process to not be consistent, however, I think the better approach is to use the Insert HTML menu item, and that should work regardless of which browser I use.&lt;/blockquote&gt;" created="Mon, 03 Jul 2017 21:17:16 GMT"/>
				<outline text="If I were more proficient at JavaScript I could probably improve the workflow significantly. First, I could write a front end to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/nodeStorage&quot;&gt;nodestorage&lt;/a&gt;, which 1999 uses to publishes HTML content. Another option would be to create a markdown editor plugin so that I wouldn’t have to convert what I write in Drafts to HTML. " created="Mon, 03 Jul 2017 21:17:17 GMT"/>
				<outline text="              " created="Mon, 03 Jul 2017 21:17:18 GMT"/>
				<outline text="Ideally, I think 1999 should provide a way for a user to specify a default editor. While I might prefer markdown as the default, others may prefer rich text, and still more may prefer HTML. The plugin method provides alternatives to the default rich text editor but causes users to jump through too many hoops.&lt;blockquote&gt;I should note that I know that the process I describe above is not a use case for which 1999 was created. Dave created 1999 to do the writing and editing in a web browser, which for the most part I can do on the iPad except for the markup.&lt;/blockquote&gt;" created="Mon, 03 Jul 2017 21:17:19 GMT"/>

				<outline text="I've been using the beta of iOS 11 on my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apple.com/ipad-pro/&quot;&gt;iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt; for a little over a week, and it has been solid, but today I noticed my first &quot;bug.&quot; I have Todoist and Outlook configured in split screen and for some reason the top line of my task list is not displaying. When I slide the list down, the rubber band effect causes the list to spring back and the top line goes under the title of the window. I fixed it by sliding the Todoist app nearly all the way to the left and then the window adjusted, slid it back and now the top line displays as it should. It appears that Todoist has an intermittent rubber banding issue.&lt;h4&gt;Titleless Posts&lt;/h4&gt;" created="Wed, 05 Jul 2017 13:20:54 GMT"/>

I think the issue is caused by when I create a title for a story. Everything appears to work as it should if I create the post in the immediate edit after creating the story, you can't add a title until a post is saved." created="Wed, 05 Jul 2017 13:20:55 GMT"/>
				<outline text="What is happening is that the original page is created using the numerical page number assigned to a titleless post and then navigation link of the previous post is updated to point to hit. Next, when I add a title a new page is created using the title name for the page name but the previous page is not deleted nor is the navigation link updated again. The situation doesn't appear every time, so I have to pay more attention to the exact sequence that causes it." created="Wed, 05 Jul 2017 13:20:56 GMT"/>

				<outline text="I moved my instance of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/fargoPublisher&quot;&gt;Fargo Publisher&lt;/a&gt; to Google Cloud Platform. The process was pretty straight forward except that I had to work around an issue caused because Nodejs doesn't have access to port 80.&amp;nbsp;" created="Fri, 28 Jul 2017 22:53:40 GMT"/>
				<outline text="One of the interesting things about Fargo Publisher is that it does not store any data on the server in which it runs and it provides a CNAME-like functionality by mapping URLs to a folder structure. What this means is that there isn't much to configuring Fargo Publisher beyond storing the bucket name and associated directories, along with Amazon AWS credentials." created="Fri, 28 Jul 2017 22:53:41 GMT"/>

The provider I had been using to host Fargo Publisher has become very unreliable, and so I decided to move it to Google Cloud Platform. (Btw, Dropbox still has not turned off their old API and therefore &lt;a href=&quot;http://notes.frankmcpherson.net/2017/07/28/curious.html&quot;&gt;Fargo still works&lt;/a&gt; with it.

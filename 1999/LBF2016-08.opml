				<outline text="Today my River4 server started having problems updating new feeds. I vaguely recall encountering the issue before and resolving it, but rather than that I decided to switch to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/river5&quot;&gt;River5&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;" created="Mon, 01 Aug 2016 20:57:55 GMT"/>
				<outline text="Here is where using Docker comes in handy because it makes it easy for me to retain my current River4 container so I can easily switch back to it, while starting a new container with River5.&amp;nbsp;" created="Mon, 01 Aug 2016 20:57:56 GMT"/>
				<outline text="While I built the River4 Docker image that I my container runs, someone else already made a &lt;a href=&quot;https://hub.docker.com/r/grassdog/river5/&quot;&gt;River5 image that is available on Docker Hub&lt;/a&gt; to be pulled.&amp;nbsp;" created="Mon, 01 Aug 2016 20:57:57 GMT"/>
				<outline text="The developer of the River5 image separated the configuration components from the data by creating separate volumes for each. He states that you can map the config volume to your local server, but doesn't provide any details. It turns out that you do need to create a lists subdirectory for storing subscription list files. &amp;nbsp;If you wanted to see the data that River5 generates you could map a local server folder to the data volume, but under normal operations you shouldn't need to see the data files." created="Mon, 01 Aug 2016 20:57:58 GMT"/>
				<outline text="What would be helpful is a way to replace the default config.json file with your own copy of config.json but according to the docs, this file needs to be in the same directory as river5.js, which means mapping a local server directory to the directory in the container in which river5.js is stored and I don't know what problems that may cause.&amp;nbsp;" created="Mon, 01 Aug 2016 20:57:59 GMT"/>
				<outline text="All this being said, &lt;a href=&quot;http://mywebstream.net/&quot;&gt;I am now running River5&lt;/a&gt; and could pretty easily switch back to River4 should I need to.&amp;nbsp;" created="Mon, 01 Aug 2016 20:58:00 GMT"/>

				<outline text="Finally, there are a couple of things Fargo provides that I like but are not in 1999, and I could live without but want to mention. One is the #stream type that organizes blog posts around dates. To me, journal-like writing such as linkblogging is best organized by date, where I can easily find what I wrote on a given date. The journal-like writing has been &lt;a href=&quot;http://webnotes.frankmcpherson.net/&quot;&gt;how I have been using Fargo&lt;/a&gt;, and in fact it is how I learned to blog using EditThisPage.&amp;nbsp;" created="Wed, 24 Aug 2016 17:12:36 GMT"/>
				<outline text="1999, while publishing content in reverse chronological order, uses Titles as the primary organizing method, as does almost all other blogging tools.

				<outline text="Dropbox provides an Application Program Interface (API) that developers can use to write programs that communicate with Dropbox and read and write files stored in Dropbox. Dropbox freely supported this method for communications and apparently they have decided it costs them too much money to continue supporting, and so they have announced they will stop providing this interface. The consequence is that developers either need to find an alternative API or service, or do as Dave has done, and decide to stop supporting their applications.&amp;nbsp;" created="Fri, 26 Aug 2016 13:28:46 GMT"/>
				<outline text="Again, the paradox is that APIs are not bad, nor is Dave wrong for making the decision he has made.

				<outline text="APIs are necessary to quickly develop new applications and services on the web by enabling one to building such services using prior work as building blocks.

In fact, this is the story of how so many web apps can continue to be quickly made by small developers at very little financial expense." created="Fri, 26 Aug 2016 13:28:48 GMT"/>
				<outline text="The message is not that developers should not use APIs, but the story of Dropbox's API does highlight the risk in using any other entity's services.

				<outline text="Another thing that I want to test on my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gsmarena.com/huawei_nexus_6p-7588.php&quot;&gt;Nexus 6P&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.droid-life.com/2016/08/24/google-wifi-assistant-nexus/&quot;&gt;WiFi Assistant&lt;/a&gt;. I am wondering whether that will automatically connect to the WiFi at Starbucks without requiring me to authenticate. Unfortunately, this is not yet available on my Nexus 6P, so I will have to wait for an update to be pushed." created="Fri, 26 Aug 2016 21:05:06 GMT"/>

For example, the lock screen notifications are more useful simply because more text displays." created="Mon, 29 Aug 2016 12:56:21 GMT"/>
				<outline text="I've also learned about &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.quinny898.app.customquicksettings&amp;amp;hl=en&quot;&gt;Custom Quick Settings&lt;/a&gt;, which allows you to create panels in the quick settings shade that appears when you sweep down with two fingers from the top of the screen. While you can use Custom Quick Settings with Android 6 Marshmallow, I think Android N improves upon it by allowing you to further edit the panel with whatever panels you want." created="Mon, 29 Aug 2016 12:56:22 GMT"/>

				<outline text="The State of Michigan is trying to ban straight party voting. Legislation was passed by the state legislature and signed by the Governor to implement the ban. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2016/08/25/if-upheld-see-how-michigans-ban-straight-party-voting-could-effect-you/89297594/&quot;&gt;A federal judge has truck it down as unconstitutional&lt;/a&gt;." created="Mon, 29 Aug 2016 16:21:12 GMT"/>
				<outline text="To me, another issue is that this is another example of politicians not representing the people. Twice the question was put on the ballot and both time the citizens of the state of Michigan voted own the ban. The latest legislation has spending attached, which makes it not subject to referendum. So, the voters in the state don't even have the ability to once again deny this change.&amp;nbsp;" created="Mon, 29 Aug 2016 16:21:13 GMT"/>

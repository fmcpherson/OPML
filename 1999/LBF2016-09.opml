				<outline text="Nexus phones are developed via a partnership between Google and a select hardware partner that have a pure Android experience, are directly updated by Google, are sold on Google's store, but are branded such that it is clearly known who is the hardware manufacturer. Nexus phones are not truly Google phones. For example, the Nexus 6P is a Huawei phone and in fact you can order a Nexus 6P either &lt;a href=&quot;https://store.google.com/product/nexus_6p&quot;&gt;from Google&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gethuawei.com/nexus6p&quot;&gt;Huawei&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;" created="Fri, 02 Sep 2016 14:59:07 GMT"/>
				<outline text="Pixel came into existence when Google announced, and later sold, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromebook_Pixel&quot;&gt;the original Chromebook Pixel&lt;/a&gt;. The Chromebook Pixel was clearly Google hardware and it is not obvious who actually manufactures it. There is no partnership with Pixel products, they are sold as Google products although clearly manufactured by some other company." created="Fri, 02 Sep 2016 14:59:08 GMT"/>
				<outline text="If true, the new Pixel smartphones will be a little unique in that we appear to know who is manufacturing them for Google, reports are it is HTC. If the past is an indicator, the Pixel phones will be only sold on Google's store and will only have Google branding.&amp;nbsp;" created="Fri, 02 Sep 2016 14:59:09 GMT"/>
				<outline text="From the beginning, Nexus has been about partnership and leading the Android smartphone market. Part of that partnership was an attempt to influence how Android phones were developed. My guess is that originally Google hoped their hardware partners would decide to just use the &quot;stock&quot; Android software and updates and focus on hardware as a their competitive advantage.&amp;nbsp;" created="Fri, 02 Sep 2016 14:59:10 GMT"/>
				<outline text="Unfortunately, while they were able to work with several different Android smartphone manufacturers over the years, none of those manufacturers decided to transform all their products to stock Android. Worse, Samsung and others have articulated their desire to use other smartphone software and not rely on Google at all.&amp;nbsp;" created="Fri, 02 Sep 2016 14:59:11 GMT"/>
				<outline text="Consequently, I think Google has decided to give up on the idea that they could influence the smartphone market via the Nexus &quot;program.&quot; Instead, it appears they have decided they will sell smartphones are that are clearly Google phones (In a way returning to the original G1 branding) and in essence be competitors with the Android smartphone manufacturers.&amp;nbsp;" created="Fri, 02 Sep 2016 14:59:12 GMT"/>

				<outline text="The other night I had a conversation with a friend who is a teacher, and it involved the state of education in the United States. I've been thinking about growth, and upon reflection on this conversation the title of Robert Fulghum's book, &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/2399046-all-i-really-need-to-know-i-learned-in-kindergarten&quot;&gt;All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, came to mind." created="Mon, 05 Sep 2016 02:08:26 GMT"/>
				<outline text="I think the title states a truth about education in the United States, elementary grades (K thru 4th) are about growth, then you have a transitional period called either middle school or junior high (5th thru 8th grades), and then you have high school.&amp;nbsp;" created="Mon, 05 Sep 2016 02:08:27 GMT"/>
				<outline text="What we have in how education is commonly structured is a transition from growth to something else that is less about growth and more about indoctrination of an ideology that we believe prepares children for adulthood.&amp;nbsp;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;" created="Mon, 05 Sep 2016 02:08:28 GMT"/>
				<outline text="Originally, the ideology was citizenship, but I think that over time the ideology has shifted towards meritocracy. Today the focus is on preparing our children to be successful, and that success is defined within the context of capitalism.&amp;nbsp;" created="Mon, 05 Sep 2016 02:08:29 GMT"/>
				<outline text="We can debate whether or not this is a good thing, I have no doubt that a great deal of people believe this is exactly what schools and teachers should be doing. However, I don't believe this is growth." created="Mon, 05 Sep 2016 02:08:30 GMT"/>
				<outline text="Why does it matter?&amp;nbsp;" created="Mon, 05 Sep 2016 02:08:31 GMT"/>
				<outline text="It matters because too many people take the first six words of Fulghum's title literally, &quot;All I Really Need to Know....&quot; Too many people believe there is a time in their life at which they really do know all they need to know. The very structure of education teaches that there is a time in life when growth stops." created="Mon, 05 Sep 2016 02:08:32 GMT"/>
				<outline text="The consequence is that individual growth ends far too early in life. A great deal of society's problems is caused by people who stay within the first half of their life and don't continue growing, and with that there is no possibility for progress unless everyone else in the world conforms to your way of seeing.&amp;nbsp;" created="Mon, 05 Sep 2016 02:08:33 GMT"/>
				<outline text="To live is to grow, and growth only occurs when one realizes they will never know all they really need to know and that every day is an opportunity for their life to be transformed.&amp;nbsp;" created="Mon, 05 Sep 2016 02:08:34 GMT"/>

			<outline text="Tradition or We've Always Done It This Way" created="Thu, 15 Sep 2016 01:12:23 GMT" type="outline">
				<outline text="When Ruth and I were seeking a church, as the more &quot;experienced&quot; church goer I had more detailed requirements. I was raised Roman Catholic so my only church experience was liturgical, and so for a service to be &quot;church&quot; for me it had to fit with what I had most experienced.&amp;nbsp;&lt;blockquote&gt;Robes, cleric collars, and liturgy hold importance for some of us because they are an imprint of what is church, &quot;because we have always done it this way.&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;" created="Thu, 15 Sep 2016 01:12:24 GMT"/>
				<outline text="Because we have always done it this way is very powerful because it gives us a sense of control, and what we most desire is being in control. I like my church just the way it is, thank you very much. Ironic, if you know the history of the Roman Catholic church and why it was assimilated by the Empire. Turns out, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gotquestions.org/origin-Catholic-church.html&quot;&gt;Constantine was very insightful&lt;/a&gt;. " created="Thu, 15 Sep 2016 01:12:25 GMT"/>
				<outline text="So questioning why we do what we do is important, and not doing things simply because we have always done them is also important. But, I think equally wrong is to stop doing things simply to not, and I wonder whether not doing something for the sake of being welcoming is simply an excuse or a true reason. Are the decisions we make today really based on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/jesus-doesnt-tweet/2015/04/30/fb07ef1a-ed01-11e4-8666-a1d756d0218e_story.html?utm_term=.0bddc76b7efd&quot;&gt;what millennials want&lt;/a&gt;, or are they based on what the generation in power (Gen X'ers) want? And, are our decisions based on a lack of appreciation for what came before, or truly formed by the Spirit in moving us forward? " created="Thu, 15 Sep 2016 01:12:26 GMT"/>
				<outline text="The word we often interchange with &quot;because we have always done it this way&quot; is tradition. Generations before us separated Roman Catholics from Protestants along the lines of tradition (as implemented by &lt;a href=&quot;http://people.howstuffworks.com/papacy1.htm&quot;&gt;papal authority&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sola_scriptura&quot;&gt;sola scripture&lt;/a&gt;. What I find ironic is that most who hold the Bible alone (or are &quot;Bible believing&quot;) don't seem to realize that they too are embracing tradition as the Bible is a record of tradition. Tradition was likely important to Jesus, who&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Every-Christian-Needs-About-Jewishness-ebook/dp/B013XB2FWS/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1473902973&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;keywords=rabbi+evan+moffic&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;is a Jew&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;raised in a Jewish tradition, and yet we Christians tend to know so very little of Jewish tradition and thought. " created="Thu, 15 Sep 2016 01:12:27 GMT"/>
				<outline text="American Christianity, in particular, tends to eschew tradition for the sake of defining Christianity within the context of an American capitalistic world view.

				<outline text="I recently started to have problems with Google Chrome where it would not load any web pages unless I was using incognito mode. The fact that it worked with incognito and not regularly provides a clue to the problem, if you understand a bit of what incognito does, but because the problem started at the same time I changed my computer's password, I was at first thinking it was caused by the password change." created="Thu, 29 Sep 2016 14:49:24 GMT"/>
				<outline text="The problem was most likely caused by some corruption in the cache on the hard drive of my computer that Chrome uses to store web pages. Incognito doesn't cache information, which is a big part of how it insures there is no trace of web browsing history on the computer.&amp;nbsp;" created="Thu, 29 Sep 2016 14:49:25 GMT"/>
				<outline text="One of the first troubleshooting steps you can try is to &lt;a href=&quot;https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/chrome/caiyitnfLvY&quot;&gt;delete all browsing history since the beginning of time&lt;/a&gt; by clicking Settings, History, Clear browsing data.&amp;nbsp;" created="Thu, 29 Sep 2016 14:49:26 GMT"/>
				<outline text="Since I really was not sure what was happening, I uninstalled Chrome from the computer and at that time told it to delete all browsing data. After uninstalling Chrome I opened File Explorer and removed c:\Users\[user id]\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome.&amp;nbsp;" created="Thu, 29 Sep 2016 14:49:27 GMT"/>
				<outline text="Finally, I re-installed Chrome, tested to confirm it was able to open web pages, and after confirming it worked I signed-in to Chrome with my Google account to synchronize my extensions.&amp;nbsp;" created="Thu, 29 Sep 2016 14:49:28 GMT"/>

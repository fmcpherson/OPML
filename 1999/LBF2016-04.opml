				<outline text="The content that I write in Fargo is stored in Dropbox (source copy), published (by FargoPublisher) to Amazon S3 (second copy), which is the copy that is served by the web server portion of FargoPublisher. More copies of my content is backed up to local computers (a Mac and Windows 7 computer) using Dropbox sync.&amp;nbsp;" created="Thu, 14 Apr 2016 21:51:31 GMT"/>
				<outline text="The current configuration that I am using for this site is storing and serving the HTML files on the same server, which is not being backed up to any other device or server.

				<outline text="From what I read, I think Dave is pushing the content he writes in 1999 to his S3 bucket that hosts Scripting.com, which I think is the exact approach I would like to take.

				<outline text="Tonight I used some sample code from the 1999-server support group to implement a script that copies what I write using my server to a S3 bucket, which I configured for web hosting. The result is everything that I write is now stored &lt;a href=&quot;http://readwrite.club:1999/users/frankm/&quot;&gt;on my server&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://writing.frankmcpherson.org/&quot;&gt;on S3&lt;/a&gt;, providing me with the backup copy I desire." created="Thu, 21 Apr 2016 01:00:43 GMT"/>
				<outline text="The configuration also resolves &lt;a href=&quot;http://notes.frankmcpherson.net/2016/04/14/testingNewBloggingSoftware.html&quot;&gt;a dependency that my Fargo blogs have on FargoPublisher to access what I write&lt;/a&gt;. FargoPublisher is the web server for the Fargo blogs, using S3 as the file system for the server.&amp;nbsp;" created="Thu, 21 Apr 2016 01:00:44 GMT"/>
				<outline text="The consequence of this configuration is that my Fargo blogs require S3 and a server running publisher.js via nodejs in order for one to access my content. If the server hosting publisher.js goes down, you cannot access &lt;a href=&quot;http://webnotes.frankmcpherson.net&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-href=&quot;http://webnotes.frankmcpherson.net&quot; data-auto-link=&quot;true&quot;&gt;webnotes.frankmcpherson.net&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;even though the site hosting the content (S3) is still up.&amp;nbsp;" created="Thu, 21 Apr 2016 01:00:45 GMT"/>

Amazon is much more capable of keeping S3 accessible than I am in keeping my servers running.&amp;nbsp;" created="Thu, 21 Apr 2016 01:00:46 GMT"/>
				<outline text="Best of all, keeping a web site running on S3 is a matter of paying the AWS bill each month, it doesn't require the ongoing administration that my Linux servers require.&amp;nbsp;" created="Thu, 21 Apr 2016 01:00:47 GMT"/>

				<outline text="In replying to a blog post that ponders how one knows about replies to a post to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://1999.io&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-auto-link=&quot;true&quot; data-href=&quot;http://1999.io&quot;&gt;1999.io&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;site, I stumbled upon a key difference between social networks and blogs.&amp;nbsp;" created="Fri, 29 Apr 2016 14:58:02 GMT"/>
				<outline text="Social networks are designed around interactions, when one replies to something on a social network the software then notifies whenever something new happens, either when other people reply or when someone replies to what you wrote." created="Fri, 29 Apr 2016 14:58:03 GMT"/>
				<outline text="Blogs have always supported &quot;messages&quot; as replies to blog posts, but don't do their best to keep the conversation flowing. &amp;nbsp;If you post a reply to this post, how will I know it? And if I reply to you, how will you know it?&amp;nbsp;" created="Fri, 29 Apr 2016 14:58:04 GMT"/>
				<outline text="An original solution was the concept of a pingback, whereby blogging software would notice when someone linked to a post one wrote and then notified you when that event occurred." created="Fri, 29 Apr 2016 14:58:05 GMT"/>
				<outline text="WordPress now uses email. When you reply to a WordPress post, you usually see an option where you can tell WordPress to send you an email to you whenever someone replies to your reply, and/or if there are any changes to the post. Doing so requires subscribing to the post in WordPress, and while this method is effective, it is also cumbersome.&amp;nbsp;" created="Fri, 29 Apr 2016 14:58:06 GMT"/>
				<outline text="RIght now it feels that &lt;a href=&quot;http://1999.io&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-auto-link=&quot;true&quot; data-href=&quot;http://1999.io&quot;&gt;1999.io&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;is half way between the two, but the notification layer is missing. I can manually browse my posts in the editor and see replies, but requires me to constantly scroll through.&amp;nbsp;" created="Fri, 29 Apr 2016 14:58:07 GMT"/>
				<outline text="A solution may be to make a view of the editor in which the articles are automatically sorted in a way where those that have replies appear at the top. Or perhaps items with replies can be viewed in a separate tab. Either way, it seems to me there needs to be a way to surface items that have replies otherwise it will be very easy for them to be overlooked.&amp;nbsp;" created="Fri, 29 Apr 2016 14:58:08 GMT"/>
				<outline text="I also wonder whether there needs to be a provision for moderation and turning off replies so that you can manage SPAM. I turn moderation on all my WordPress sites because most of the replies are SPAM that I don't want actually published to the site.&amp;nbsp;" created="Fri, 29 Apr 2016 14:58:09 GMT"/>

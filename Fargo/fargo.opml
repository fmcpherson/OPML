						<outline text="I intend to write a more complete blog post about my experience with the &quot;Nexus 6P&quot; to date. In a nutshell, I am really happy with the battery life. The combination of the larger battery, &lt;a href=&quot;https://plus.google.com/+AndroidDevelopers/posts/A7BYzzSZ3b6&quot;&gt;Doze&lt;/a&gt;, and USB-C fast charging is a hit, I might no longer need to worry about battery life. " created="Mon, 16 Nov 2015 14:34:24 GMT"/>
						<outline text="With the Moto X I needed to be certain to start the day with a full charge by re-charging the phone overnight, and around dinner time the battery would be around 30% and therefore requiring some re-charge during the day. During the weekday I topped off the Moto X during my commute to and from the office, but that rarely got the phone to 100%." created="Mon, 16 Nov 2015 14:39:02 GMT"/>
						<outline text="First off, &lt;a href=&quot;http://bgr.com/2015/06/08/android-m-nexus-5-doze-battery-test/&quot;&gt;Doze does a much better time extending battery life&lt;/a&gt; than I expected, and this confirms how differently I use my Nexus 9 tablet and my smartphone. I tend to use my tablet for long stretches of time, reading books, social networks, and articles, and therefore Doze does not have as dramatic affect because the tablet is hardly sitting idle. The phone, on the other hand, is used in short spurts, with significant down time between, and in those instances Doze does a fantastic job of quieting background stuff to conserve battery life and I have not noticed any lag in receiving notifications. " created="Mon, 16 Nov 2015 14:37:38 GMT"/>
						<outline text="Next, fasts charging is wonderful and it along with Doze is changing how I think about recharging the phone. With the Moto X, I was sure to get it fully charged to start my day, now I about topping off the Nexus 6P whenever I have a chance. During the weekdays, I take care of this during the office commute, other days I plug it in during meals. The point is, I am starting to not worry that all of sudden my phone will be dead because of the battery. " created="Mon, 16 Nov 2015 14:44:37 GMT"/>
						<outline text="The biggest piece of supporting evidence for the Nexus 6P battery life is this. When I bought the 6P, I also bought a new quick charging USB-C automobile adapter and an additional USB-C charger for the office. While I am using the automobile adapter during commutes, I have yet to take the additional USB-C charger out of the box. " created="Mon, 16 Nov 2015 14:48:20 GMT"/>

While it correctly provides an option to create a Calendar event, it doesn't provide enough help in populating the information for the event. For example, it ever finds the subject of the webinar, even when it is in the subject line of the email message, and I find it odd that Now On Tap seems to not determine that what is displayed on the screen is an email.

Part of the problem may be that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/tech-sanity-check/steve-jobs-proclaims-the-post-pc-era-has-arrived/&quot;&gt;Steve Job's claim&lt;/a&gt; that tablets (he was speaking specifically about the iPad) are the new personal computer is proving to be true and with that comes longer refresh cycles. For many people, the iPad they bought last year is still good and will be good enough next year, which does not bode well for Apple.

						<outline text="The writer basically says the Pixel C will fail because Android is not optimized for productivity, but that depends on one's requirements and everyone's is slightly different.

I think that the Microsoft Office mobile apps work very well on Android and I can be pretty productive with them." created="Thu, 01 Oct 2015 17:04:53 GMT"/>
						<outline text="Further, the writer claims that Android is simply not good for tablets. I don't think Android's UI is any worse on tablets than iOS.

						<outline text="Where I do think Google has a problem that may affect the Pixel C is with Android's performance on the Nvidia processor. If my personal experience with the Nexus 9 is any indication, Android has some real problems with the Nvidia. My Nexus 9 seems to need to be rebooted every day to clear up whatever memory jankyness is going on.

						<outline text="Android's quality seems to be increasingly worse with each new release, and nobody seems to be writing much about the issue.

							<outline text="In my opinion, the big (literally) news from today's Apple event is the iPad Pro. Everything else that Apple announced were incremental improvements aimed at getting us to buy more of the same stuff. The iPad Pro is the closest to something new." created="Wed, 09 Sep 2015 19:06:26 GMT"/>
							<outline text="Expect most of the press to focus on the Pencil, and how Steve Jobs was so against styluses. On the other hand, the iPad Pro legitimizes Microsoft's efforts at creating an enterprise tablet market. For those who have been saying tablets can be productivity devices, Apple has finally said, they agree." created="Wed, 09 Sep 2015 19:07:56 GMT"/>
							<outline text="The question is, do people really want 12.9&quot; tablets? Even if they are thin and light, a 12.9&quot; device is big, possibly too big to carry around comfortably. The Surface 3 Pro screen is a little smaller, at 12 inches, and Microsoft markets it as a landscape-oriented device, which in my mind makes the screen appear smaller. Hold a Surface 3 Pro or an iPad Pro in portrait and it will feel huge. " created="Wed, 09 Sep 2015 19:09:42 GMT"/>
							<outline text="Back to the Pencil. I hope we quickly get past all the snarky, Steve Jobs wouldn't do that, comments. There is a big difference between how one uses a stylus today and how one had to use them with the original Tablet PC, Pocket PC, and Palm PDAs. " created="Wed, 09 Sep 2015 19:13:45 GMT"/>
							<outline text="The devices of ten years ago required a stylus to operate because all the controls on the screen were so small. Turns out, people prefer touch-operated devices that don't require styluses, which at worst can be easily lost, and at best take time to retrieve and use. " created="Wed, 09 Sep 2015 19:15:21 GMT"/>
							<outline text="Yet, for some, there are legit use cases for a stylus, use cases that don't require one to use the stylus for general operation of the device like with a Pocket PC. Artistic people like styluses for drawing on the screen, while some, like me, like using styluses to write notes in digital ink. " created="Wed, 09 Sep 2015 19:17:01 GMT"/>
							<outline text="It will be interesting to see how many people buy the iPad Pro. The prices are high, particularly when you add the keyboard and Pencil. Who will find it worth the price, particularly when you have all those other, cheaper iPads, not to mention cheaper tablets from competitors? My gut says the iPad Pro has a niche market, the size of which is at this time unknown. " created="Wed, 09 Sep 2015 19:18:48 GMT"/>

The second important question that I don't think anyone raises is, how do I derive value from my personal data? For example, if my smartphone tracks where I am always located, I should be able to use that information as evidence if, say a government agency claimed I was at a location on a given date and time when I know I was not.

In the Evernote Android app running on Chrome OS, however, notes don't start synchronizing to the app to be available until after you start the app and I have found that synchronization to be much slower than on my Android tablet. Part of the reason for this may be that I don't frequently run the Android app on Chrome as I do on my tablet.

As one who followed and had access to Microsoft's OS development from 1997 through 2006, I am convinced the fatal flaw was Microsoft's insistence that Windows CE/Windows Mobile look and work like Windows desktop.

I look at this from another point of view, which is that the police in the United States is not the same thing as the military and therefore must be treated differently. If we accept the police as military we then are stepping into martial law, which really means that the &quot;rule of law&quot; we have in the United States and the judicial system that enforces it, no longer exists. We cease to exist as the United States of America as most of us have grown up to understand it, and instead we have a U.S. where the police become judge and jury.

That being said, &lt;a href=&quot;http://phandroid.com/2014/07/16/stop-treating-android-wear-like-a-phone&quot;&gt;this article by Phandroid&lt;/a&gt; resonates with me because it aligns to &lt;a href=&quot;http://webnotes.frankmcpherson.net/2014/06/25/#a1403716423&quot;&gt;my thoughts&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/events/io&quot;&gt;the Android Wear announcement at Google I/O&lt;/a&gt;." type="idea" name="itsTimeToStopTreatingAndroidWearLikeAPhoneIHaventWrittenAnythingAboutAndroidWearForTwoReasonsFirstShortlyAfterTheAnnouncedIWentOnAVacationThatHadMeOfflineAndSecondIDecidedThatItMightBeBestToWaitUntilIActuallyHadADeviceThatBeingSaidThisArticleByPhandroidResonatesWithMeBecauseItAlignsToMyThoughtsDuringTheAndroidWearAnnouncementAtGoogleIo" created="Thu, 17 Jul 2014 19:04:49 GMT" url="http://phandroid.com/2014/07/16/stop-treating-android-wear-like-a-phone" isComment="false" isFeedItem="true"/>
						<outline text="I couldn't help but think during the demonstrations of Android Wear that there was too much complexity being shown. All the swipping around to navigate seemed to me to be too complicated. It felt as though Google was trying to show how smartwatches could replace smartphones. Except that Android Wear devices are really intended to be accessories to smartphones.   " created="Thu, 17 Jul 2014 19:06:53 GMT"/>
						<outline text="I think that for devices to really succeed in the market, they should adhere to this maxim: the smaller the device, the more specific the function. For Android Wear to succeed, the devices need to look great and what they do needs to work really, really well. Oh, and the price is going to matter, because in the end, despite all the apps that you will find in the Play Store that exist simply because they can, smart watches are going to be useful for only a few things.

						<outline text="My fear is that the demonstrations at Google I/O are setting an expectation that is not realistic. You might be able to create all sorts of complicated apps for the smart watches, but are people going to really use them?

Just as smartphones can do almost everything that a notebook computer can do, smartwatches will likely be able to do almost everything a smartphone can do, but people don't really use nor think of smartphones as notebook computers. Smartphones are a different type of personal computer, in fact I think it's the first &lt;a href=&quot;http://realpersonalcomputing.com&quot;&gt;real personal computer&lt;/a&gt;.

We got to the site by 3 PM, the fireworks started at 10 PM.

						<outline text="By now you have most likely heard about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://heartbleed.com&quot;&gt;Heartbleed &lt;/a&gt;vulnerability. Simply put, up until a few days ago there was a bug in the software that secures most web sites. Even if you saw the little lock in the browser address bar your information, like user ids and passwords, could have been captured." created="Fri, 11 Apr 2014 19:48:21 GMT"/>
						<outline text="If you are paying attention you most likely decided to change all your passwords, and you may have also most likely come to the realization that you have a bazillion passwords. The need for so many passwords is a real problem and Heartbleed exposes that problem. " created="Fri, 11 Apr 2014 19:48:58 GMT"/>
						<outline text="You should not use the same passwords for web sites that contain any sensitive information, yet if you are going to use say more than seven web sites, how is one to create and remember so many passwords? What I do for this problem is used an app called &lt;a href=&quot;https://lastpass.com/&quot;&gt;LastPass&lt;/a&gt;. " created="Fri, 11 Apr 2014 19:50:34 GMT"/>
						<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;https://lastpass.com/how-it-works/&quot;&gt;LastPass generates strong passwords&lt;/a&gt;, passwords that are at least 12 characters long with random characters and stores them for me in an encrypted database. When I access one of my trusted computers, I log in to LastPass and when I need to access a web site I retrieve my user id and password from it. " created="Fri, 11 Apr 2014 19:52:28 GMT"/>
						<outline text="Another way that LastPass has helped me with Heartbleed is that &lt;a href=&quot;https://lastpass.com/heartbleed/&quot;&gt;it provides a tool&lt;/a&gt; to scan all the web sites for which I have passwords, checks to see when that site's SSL certificate was changed, compared it to when I last changed my password for that site, and then told me whether or not I need to update my password. Of course, this tools is only as useful as the number of web sites I use LastPass with, otherwise it doesn't know I used the site nor when I last changed my password.  " created="Fri, 11 Apr 2014 19:54:33 GMT"/>
						<outline text="In an ideal world, there would be another way for us to secure access to web sites. It might combine something I know (like a password I memorize), with something I have that is embedded within the computing device I am using in a highly secured manner. This is known as &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication&quot;&gt;multi-factor authentication&lt;/a&gt;, and is used by several web sites like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/landing/2step/&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=10150172618258920&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.twitter.com/2013/getting-started-with-login-verification&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.evernote.com/blog/2013/10/04/two-step-verification-available-to-all-users/&quot;&gt;Evernote&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://helpdesk.lastpass.com/security-options/multifactor-authentication-options/&quot;&gt;LastPass&lt;/a&gt;.

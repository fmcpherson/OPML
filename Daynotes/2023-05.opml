				<outline text="Does screen refresh really matter on smartphones?" created="Tue, 23 May 2023 15:29:21 GMT" type="outline">
					<outline text="One of the unwritten rules of tech is the idea that more is better, the purpose of which is to have us continually buy the latest generation of a product. The rule began with the model year releases of automobiles and became adopted by the tech industry. Unfortunately, we consumers don't often enough question whether the latest features really do matter. We aren't helped by tech reviewers who often seem to advocate more for the tech industry than consumers. An example that I am thinking about is the push for faster refresh rates on smartphones." created="Tue, 23 May 2023 15:22:45 GMT" type="outline"/>
					<outline text="If you have read smartphone reviews over the last year or so you have probably been convinced that phones with 60Hz refresh screens are bad and really should be avoided. We all should be clamoring for 120Hz or at least 90Hz screens so that we get the fastest, smoothest screen scrolling. Do we, really, need smartphone screens faster than 60Hz?" created="Tue, 23 May 2023 15:29:10 GMT" type="outline"/>
					<outline text="Up until last week I have been using the Pixel 4a, and it's &quot;limited,&quot; 60Hz screen as my daily driver. When I got the new Pixel 7a I dutifully changed the setting, as prescribed by nearly all tech reviewers, to turn on Smooth Display so that it displays at 90Hz. Every reviewer who directs one to make this change intones something to the affect, &quot;why is Smooth Display not enabled by default?&quot;" created="Tue, 23 May 2023 15:33:13 GMT" type="outline"/>
					<outline text="While I can say, yes, after turning on Smooth Display scrolling text up/down on the Pixel 7a is faster, what nobody seems to ask is, on a 6-inch display, does one really need that scrolling to be faster? I am skeptical. I am thinking we are being convinced that faster smartphone refresh rates are needed, but they really are not. Increase the size of the screen to perhaps the 11-inch standard tablet, or larger, and I can see how faster refresh can really matter, but on a 6-inch screen? " created="Tue, 23 May 2023 15:35:55 GMT" type="outline"/>
					<outline text="Another example, at least to me, is the &quot;insistence&quot; that we all need 5G wireless data on our phones. Of course, I ran a speed test using the Pixel 7a as soon as I could and observed the fact that the 86 Mbps download feature is faster than the &quot;plain&quot; LTE transfer speed of my Pixel 4a. Ok, but in what way am I really going to notice or even need that faster transfer speed on a smartphone with a 6-inch screen? For example, I streamed video on the Pixel 7a and it looked no better to me than on the Pixel 4a. Again, if I were on a tablet or certainly a PC then I would likely benefit by the faster transfer rate, but I doubt that 5G is really going to make difference on the Pixel 7a." created="Tue, 23 May 2023 15:39:45 GMT" type="outline"/>
					<outline text="To be fair, I do gain some benefits in the upgrade from the Pixel 4a to the 7a. I am finding the front, under-screen finger print scanner is much better than the back scanner of the 4a. The camera is much better and thus I am getting better pictures. Battery life seems to be better, probably thanks to a larger battery and the Tensor G2 chip, and I am happy to finally have the convenience of wireless charging." created="Tue, 23 May 2023 15:45:11 GMT" type="outline"/>
					<outline text="Truth is, we likely reached peak smartphone many years ago, therefore there are really fewer needed new features that really matter, and consequently there is a need for more marketing to get people to buy phones. If you are wondering why Google will be selling the Pixel Fold, the reason why is because the smartphone &quot;industry&quot; is convinced such foldables are needed in order to keep selling phones over the next ten years. (The main case for foldables is people want to carry smaller devices, but ironically that could be served by selling phones with smaller screens!) In my opinion, the only change in smartphones that we really need is in battery life, and the technical problem of gaining more battery life from the same size batteries appears to be impossible to overcome. Ironically, one way to improve battery life is to set the screen refresh to 60Hz and use slower file transfer speeds, but then we could get by with last year's phone." created="Tue, 23 May 2023 15:48:57 GMT" type="outline"/>

Ideally, I would be able to configure the phone/stand to only charge when the battery is less than X% and only charge to Y%. Once fully charged the charging should stop and the stand just acts like a stand." created="Mon, 22 May 2023 13:56:29 GMT" type="outline"/>
				<outline text="Given that the Pixel knows when it is on the stand so that it acts as a picture frame, it would seem that Google expects one to put the phone on the charger for extended periods of time. " created="Mon, 22 May 2023 14:04:17 GMT" type="outline"/>
				<outline text="Today is the first work day using the Pixel 7a and I am wondering about whether or not it is a good idea to keep the phone on the wireless charging stand that is on my desk. If I keep putting it on the stand during the day then it will continually charge. I think the phone and charger should be smart enough to stop charging when the battery is full and thus not damage the battery, but I don't know this for certain. I did enable &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.howtogeek.com/803245/how-adaptive-charging-saves-your-android-battery/&quot;&gt;adaptive charging&lt;/a&gt;, but that seems to be optimized for night time charging and based off alarms, so I don't know if it will do anything during the day. &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=wireless+charging+and+battery+health&amp;t=newext&amp;atb=v342-1&amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;Articles&lt;/a&gt; that I have read &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/does-wireless-charging-degrade-your-battery-faster/&quot;&gt;about wireless charging and battery life&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/a0q2rk/dumb_question_is_it_bad_to_keep_the_phone_on/&quot;&gt;not conclusive&lt;/a&gt;." created="Mon, 22 May 2023 12:47:25 GMT" type="outline"/>

				<outline text="I caved in yesterday and ordered the Pixel 7a from Amazon, which gets me the $50 gift card at least. I expect that over time the price for the Pixel 7a will come down to closer to $400, may be as soon as Amazon Prime day in July. Probably at the end of the year Google will stop selling the Pixel 6a, which will allow the price of the 7a to drop down further and make room for the Pixel 8a announcement next year. On the other hand, if the rumors are true and the this is the end of the line for the &quot;A Series&quot; then the 6a might stick around through Google I/O when they announce the Pixel 8. Seems like the future plans ride on what Google announces this fall. " created="Fri, 19 May 2023 14:00:06 GMT" type="outline"/>
				<outline text="So, I am probably paying $100 more to be an early owner, but doing so enables me to stop feeling left out as I see friends playing with their new toy. I should receive the Pixel 7a some time later today, which gives me the weekend to migrate everything over. The most painful part of the migration will likely be moving the Pixel Watch.

				<outline text="The biggest impact the Internet has had on society is the compression of time. Nearly everything happens faster today than it did ten years ago. In the past in terms of society, change took years, even decades to occur, much longer than most wanted but none-the-less had to accept. Problem is that we now have generations of people who did not live prior to the Internet and they expect change to happen much, much faster, and they will not accept waiting for decades. The people who do not want fast change, which is probably at least Gen X and older, appear willing to revert to authoritarianism to prevent the change they do not want because they view such change as an infringement on their liberties.

The biggest problem with the foldables is the cost, followed by their weight. If cost were to get down to the levels of regular smartphones then the screen/hinge durability becomes less an issue because fewer people who own them for more than a year. On the other hand, when looking at the price one probably should factor in the cost of a smartphone and iPad Mini given that something like the Google Fold would replace both devices.

				<outline text="As I said, I plan to buy a Pixel 7a, the question is when. I think it's interesting that both Best Buy and Amazon are offering $50 gift cards for an implicit discount. Best Buy actually provides another $50 discount if one were to &quot;activate&quot; their phone when purchased even if the phone claims to be unlocked. My guess is that the telcos provide Best Buy discounts if they get new customers. I am not in a rush and I think that if the past holds true the price will come down, or their may be a good deal on Amazon Prime day.

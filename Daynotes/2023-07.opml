				<outline text="Replacing Evernote" created="Sun, 30 Jul 2023 20:58:11 GMT" type="outline">
					<outline text="You may have read about the ongoing changes occurring with Evernote. It seems as though every year a change occurs with the company behind Evernote that results in speculation that its demise is imminent. I've been using Evernote nearly since it first became a product and while I don't use it for writing notes it evolved into my document repository. The fact that Evernote runs on every computer platform I use and the web means I can access anything I store in it from any device I use in any place I may be. Evernote has what may be the best web clipper that I have used over the years to capture clips of receipts and any other information on the web that I may want to store. The clipper is available as an extension/plugin for all the major browsers and also exists in the Share functionality of both Android and iPadOS. " created="Sun, 30 Jul 2023 20:58:25 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Moving away from Evernote to another product, or products, is a two step process. One step is importing all of the current notes with the fidelity needed for them to be useful, by which I mean embedded images and PDFs need to import into the same documents so that I can find and read them in the same was as I do today with Evernote. The second step is picking and using a replacement web clipping and mobile sharing application. Ideally, both of these steps involve the same application and work in the same way as Evernote." created="Sun, 30 Jul 2023 21:07:29 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I think the biggest challenge will be with finding another app that runs on all of the platforms I use: MacOS, iPadOS, Windows, Android, Linux, Firefox, and Chrome, and it is accessible from anywhere via the public Internet. I could live with only using an web application if I have to, but prefer native applications for at least MacOS, iPadOS, and Android. I don't have a problem moving the current archive of notes from Evernote to a separate application from what I will use going forward, so the replacement app can start with a clean slate.  " created="Sun, 30 Jul 2023 21:11:01 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Over the past years I have done research and testing for possible replacements. Two years ago or so I imported my Evernote notes in to OneNote and found that it worked pretty well except for one quirk in that it imported ever 100 notes in two separate sections, for example I end up with a section named &quot;Pages 1-100&quot; and another section named &quot;Pages 101-200&quot; and so on. It's not a show stopper because I use search more than navigation, but an oddity none the less. OneNote is accessible on nearly every platform I use but the OneNote Clipper is no longer supported as an extension in Firefox, which has become my main browser. I could move back to Chrome but I find it frustrating it is not on Firefox. " created="Sun, 30 Jul 2023 21:15:47 GMT"/>

				<outline text="Importing Evernote Notes In Obsidian" created="Sun, 30 Jul 2023 21:22:48 GMT" type="outline">
					<outline text="This past week the Linking Your Thinking YouTube video had &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/3Hm8P9kcOR0&quot;&gt;a video on switching from Evernote to Obsidian&lt;/a&gt;. I think the pitch being made in the video to replace Evernote with Obsidian is a bit over the top but it provides what turns out to be simple instructions for importing Evernote Exports in to Obsidian using the Importer community plugin. I followed the instructions to create a Evernote folder in my main Obsidian vault (I don't use Obsidian much so this vault doesn't have much in it) and then create subfolders for each of the imported Evernote notebooks. The key thing is that web clips that became embedded images or HTML linked images import with the same fidelity as they appear in Evernote, so the result is I now all of those notes in a new app so if for some reason Evernote were to just down tomorrow I will not have lost anything. (The first thing I did when I heard about the latest news was create a fresh export of all my Evernote notes I want to be sure to note lose.)" created="Sun, 30 Jul 2023 21:23:11 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Problem is, these Evernote notes are only accessible in my Macbook. Obsidian does not store notes on a server accessed via the Internet, but it does provide a form of peer synchronization between instances of the app running on different platforms. I don't pay for the synchronization add-on because I don't need it as so far I have only dabbled with Obsidian. " created="Sun, 30 Jul 2023 21:33:27 GMT"/>
					<outline text="A interesting upside is that the Obsidian importer actually converts each Evernote note to a markdown file that is stored in a folder named by the notebook in which the note was contained. Any embedded or attached items are stored in another folder and the importer creates a markdown link to each of those items. I should able to copy the entire folder structure from the home folder on my Macbook to a file sharing service like Google Drive or OneDrive and at worse case be able to find the markdown file and open them using any text editor. " created="Sun, 30 Jul 2023 21:37:38 GMT"/>
					<outline text="By the way, I had found a MacOS command line tool called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/wormi4ok/evernote2md&quot;&gt;evernot2md&lt;/a&gt; that converts Evernote notes to markdown files but it does not handled embedded images consistently and so I decided it does not fit my need.

				<outline text="Seeking A New Web Clipper" created="Sun, 30 Jul 2023 21:46:37 GMT" type="outline">
					<outline text="I now am going to shift my focus on finding a replacement for capturing and storing web clippings. First, I am starting with OneNote. I've created a new notebook in OneNote to store all of my new web clips, but as I said it doesn't work in Firefox so that forces me to pre-plan or take an extra step with my web clipping. If I am on a PC I could always print to a PDF and store the result. " created="Sun, 30 Jul 2023 21:46:55 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I am also going to take a look at what web clipping options exist for Obsidian, although I have doubts about mobile. I found an app called &lt;a href=&quot;https://mymind.com/&quot;&gt;mymind&lt;/a&gt; that is optimized for web clipping, works on the important platforms I use, but I am not thrilled with the idea of paying for a subscription. I think I could also clip to Roam, but while that is what I am using for my personal notetaking I am not sure I want to use it for storing web clips." created="Sun, 30 Jul 2023 21:51:18 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I would consider &lt;a href=&quot;https://archivebox.io/&quot;&gt;Archivebox&lt;/a&gt;, which I am selfhosting on a Raspberry Pi, but it doesn't have a mobile app. Capture from mobile devices is very important to me as I think that is how I create more than have of these clippings. " created="Sun, 30 Jul 2023 21:56:11 GMT"/>
					<outline text="The search for a web clipper/document capture replacement is probably going to take me me some time. If you have ideas for options I would am in interested in learning about them. " created="Sun, 30 Jul 2023 21:58:13 GMT"/>

Personally, I think what they have already done deserves the front office standing pat and not selling Bellinger or Stroman, they have shown they can be competitive.

				<outline text="My First Experience With Matter" created="Sun, 16 Jul 2023 22:49:45 GMT" type="outline">
					<outline text="Eight years ago I began my experience with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things&quot;&gt;Internet of Things&lt;/a&gt; when I purchased a set of two white &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philips_Hue&quot;&gt;Hue lights&lt;/a&gt; and a Hue bridge. I put one of the lights in a lamp in our basement and the second in a lamp in our living room and used the Hue app to control the lights and create simple automations like turning the lights on at sunset and turning them off at a designated time later in the evening. Later I added two color lights for use in the basement that I use for a variety of settings when watching TV and movies.   " created="Sun, 16 Jul 2023 22:12:32 GMT" type="outline"/>
					<outline text="A year later we had a failure with our sump pump that caused flooding in our basement and a subsequent remodeling. After completing the remodeling I wanted to put a moisture sensor in the sump pump pit that will alert us when water reaches to a higher than normal level, but well below the top of the pit. Philips only sold lights, so I turned to another vendor known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SmartThings&quot;&gt;SmartThings&lt;/a&gt; to buy a moisture sensor that required me to buy another hub. " created="Sun, 16 Jul 2023 22:19:16 GMT" type="outline"/>
					<outline text="It was at this point that I encountered the largest obstacle to the Internet of Things, a vendor lock-in that kept me from being able to use the Hue hub, which has a Zigbee radio, with other products that also use &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zigbee&quot;&gt;Zigbee&lt;/a&gt;. I was forced to add another hub to my home network and both hubs require a physical LAN connection. SmartThings, which was later acquired by Samsung, is more open than Hue, but it can't directly communicate with the Hue lights, I have to connect the SmartThings app on my phone to my Hue account to control lights. A similar set up is needed to use Amazon's Alexa or Google Home to control Hue lights and devices controlled by SmartThings. " created="Sun, 16 Jul 2023 22:25:08 GMT" type="outline"/>
					<outline text="While there are smart lights one can use directly with SmartThings, Alexa, and Google Home, I think the Hue app is still the leader in providing scenes that mix colors across lights to produce various effects. The need to stick with a specific vendor or install multiple hubs is the reason why Matter exists. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter_(standard)&quot;&gt;Matter&lt;/a&gt; is a standard that along with a communication protocol called Threads is or will be supported by multiple vendors that promises to not only allow many more products to work with the same hub, or controller, like Alexa, Google Nest or SmartThings but also make the setup process easier. " created="Sun, 16 Jul 2023 22:28:47 GMT" type="outline"/>
					<outline text="Having been in development for many years, the Matter standard was released mid last year and official Matter products started to be available late last year. I have been keeping an eye on the products that are available and decided on Amazon Prime day to purchase a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BNWGZ545&quot;&gt;TP-Link Tapo Matter compatible smart plug&lt;/a&gt; that I received yesterday and set up today. " created="Sun, 16 Jul 2023 22:34:33 GMT" type="outline"/>
					<outline text="I planned to use either Google Home or SmartThings to configure and control the switch. The instructions for the switch are minimal and I did not install the Tapo app that TP-Link provides. My first surprise is that immediately after plugging the switch to power a Google Home notification appeared indicating a devices was available to be added. I proceeded to the next step that involved capturing a QR code that is on the switch and then letting the set up proceed that ultimately failed. While the device appeared to be recognized, it didn't look like network communication was taking place. " created="Sun, 16 Jul 2023 22:37:22 GMT" type="outline"/>
					<outline text="Next I unplugged the device and plugged it back in, but this time there was no notification on my phone. I decided to see whether I could have more luck using SmartThings, manually starting the process to add a device, but that seemed to also get stuck at network communication. Small as the documents that came with the switch are, they did tell me that if there was a problem and the phone was connected to 5 Ghz WiFi revert the older 2.6 Ghz WiFi and try again, which I did. " created="Sun, 16 Jul 2023 22:42:10 GMT" type="outline"/>
					<outline text="I did not have success at getting the switch configured with either Google Home or SmartThings even after switching my Pixel 7a to our 2.6 GHz WiFi network. The switch instructions also provide steps to reset the network and reset the switch to factory defaults, which I did by holding the power button down for ten seconds. After having done those changes, starting Google Home and manually adding a new device, I saw more progress that included an exchange of Matter credentials. Eventually I saw the steps to name the device and designate where it is located in my home and set up was complete with the switch accessible via Google Home and thus my Nest hub and Google Assistant on my Pixel 7a. " created="Sun, 16 Jul 2023 22:45:09 GMT" type="outline"/>
					<outline text="Clearly, the setup process was not as smooth as promised by those who created Matter, but in the end I was able to add a device made and sold by TP-Link directly to Google Home without having to install another TP-Link app. I have other WiFi-only TP-Link switches that to control with Google Home I needed to add to the TP-Link Kasa app with a TP-Link account that I then provided to Google Home. We are in the early days of Matter and we can expect the set up process to be smoother, for example the setup process ought to gracefully handle different WiFi bands. My plan going forward is to only buy IoT products that support Matter in the hope that some time down the road I can remove one or more of the hubs that I have accumulated over time.

				<outline text="Having read some articles &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/?p=1952442&quot;&gt;about Evernote&lt;/a&gt;, I've decided to start transitioning away from how I have been using it and probably not renew when my account expires in January. First step is to find an alternate web clipper and right now I am leaning toward OneNote because it is available on all of the operating systems that I use, but I am finding that the OneNote web clipper extension is not available for all of the web browsers that I use." created="Mon, 10 Jul 2023 21:26:51 GMT" type="outline"/>
				<outline text="Specifically, OneNote web clipper is not available for Firefox, which is my primary browser on Mac and Linux. A thought occurred to me that I could use Microsoft Edge on Linux, but that is really just an Electron app AND the OneNote web clipper installation sees it as a mobile browser rather than a desktop. Ironically, this means that the best way for me to use the OneNote web clipper is with Chrome." created="Mon, 10 Jul 2023 21:29:06 GMT" type="outline"/>
				<outline text="Just found another issue with using OneNote, which is that the OneNote share sheet in iPadOS creates a PDF copy of the web page rather than a HTML page like on desktops. " created="Mon, 10 Jul 2023 21:36:33 GMT" type="outline"/>
				<outline text="I do note that just because Evernote has moved their operations outside of the United States does not mean it is near closing down. The move does suggest that Evernote is in &quot;cost cutting&quot; mode and makes one wonder whether they will increase prices in the future." created="Mon, 10 Jul 2023 21:51:25 GMT" type="outline"/>

				<outline text="Reading once again that the demise of Evernote is imminent, which seems to happen at least once a year. I have a lot of stuff in Evernote, but the criticality of that stuff is not clear to me. I've created exports of my most recently used notebooks and I have learned about &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/wormi4ok/evernote2md&quot;&gt;an app that converts Evernote exports to markdown&lt;/a&gt; that I am going to experiment with. I figure once I have this stuff in markdown they can be imported in to a number of alternate applications. " created="Thu, 06 Jul 2023 18:25:47 GMT" type="outline"/>

				<outline text="I am already seeing posts in Threads that are not from the people who I follow... so, looks like it will get as noisy as Twitter and I am not sure whether I need that in my life. None the less, I my bet is that &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2023/07/06/134151.html&quot;&gt;Threads will prevail&lt;/a&gt; simply because it is easy for people to get on ans see a &quot;populated&quot; network of at least who they follow on Instagram. Given how many celebrities already use Instagram, those will all be on Threads instantly... and that is not something Bluesky or Mastodon can replicate.

				<outline text="Interesting that it is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threads.net/&quot;&gt;Threads&lt;/a&gt;, an Instagram app. The start up process is easy because you re-use your Instagram account and can follow everyone you follow in Instagram. A quick perusal suggests nearly everyone I follow on Instagram has created an account on Threads, obviously this enables them to overcome a huge barrier to entry that being one's network of people they follow. Starting up on Mastodon and Bluesky is starting from a blank slate. Here is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threads.net/@fmcpherson&quot;&gt;a link to my public profile on Threads&lt;/a&gt;." created="Thu, 06 Jul 2023 13:53:31 GMT" type="outline"/>

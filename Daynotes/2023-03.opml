					<outline text="&gt; The Perennial Philosophy is a term used to describe a set of spiritual beliefs that are shared across many different religions and philosophical traditions. It is based on the idea that there is an underlying truth that is common to all spiritual traditions, and that this truth can be experienced through direct spiritual experience. The Perennial Philosophy is also sometimes referred to as the “Eternal Wisdom” or the “Primordial Tradition”." created="Tue, 28 Mar 2023 14:56:39 GMT" type="markdown"/>

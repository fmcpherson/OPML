					<outline text="Officially the All-Star game is considered to be the half-way mark of a MLB season, but the real mid-season milestone that matters is the trade deadline. The actions taken by a team by the trade deadline indicate whether the team management thinks it can make the playoffs, if they do then they will try to make trades that help the team win in the current season, otherwise they start work on the next season. Jed Hoyer's comments that he was focusing on 2025 was indication that Cub's management doesn't expect to make the playoffs this year." created="Wed, 31 Jul 2024 13:23:13 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Last season the Chicago Cubs were surprising buyers at the deadline, having gone on a winning streak that convinced Jed Hoyer the team had the shot at a wildcard spot, but that didn't happen and David Ross the scapegoat. Now this season, after signing Craig Counsell to the highest salary of any MLB manager the Cubs are last in the NL Central with a 51-58 record and they are seven games out of the last wild card spot. In short, the Cubs are  likely not making the playoffs this year. Are they going to fire Counsell?" created="Wed, 31 Jul 2024 13:25:19 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Even though the playoff positioning is different between last year and this year, a fair assessment is that the team is really no better than  the year before, nor the year before that or any other year up to 2016. What we have is the same problems of unreliable hitting and pitching from the bullpen. The fact that the 2024 team's starting pitching has been so good is as much an indicator of how much MLB has changed since 2016 than anything. It used to be that teams with strong starting pitching were winners, but the game now does not rely so much on starting pitching to win games. " created="Wed, 31 Jul 2024 13:27:26 GMT"/>
					<outline text="The sole purpose of starting pitching in the game today is to not lose the game in the first five innings by not giving up more than three runs, the bullpen is expected to now win every game by not giving up any runs. If that weren't bad enough, hitting is a completely lost art in baseball, with hitters needing only a .244 batting average to be considered good. The game has come down to this, pitching keeping the opponents from hitting home runs until your own batters hit two or more home runs. " created="Wed, 31 Jul 2024 13:31:10 GMT"/>
					<outline text="The Chicago Cubs line up has been made up of the similar type of unreliable hitters for nearly a decade now, which is a clear indicator to me that the front office's idea of what is a major league hitter is out of sync with reality. As long as Hoyer is running the Cubs they will not be any different, and so it's on ownership to recognize the insanity of continuing to do the same thing and expecting a different result.  " created="Wed, 31 Jul 2024 13:35:24 GMT"/>
					<outline text="If I were the owner of the Chicago Cubs, now that the trade deadline has past, I would fire Hoyer immediately to signal that it's time for a change. Take the time to review and interview people over the remainder of the season to find the right replacement to have your new front office in place before the off season begins in earnest." created="Wed, 31 Jul 2024 13:38:09 GMT"/>

I know there is a difference between what we like and who we are, and those who read my writing about religion may say, &quot;I like the Green Bay Packers&quot; but I wouldn't say that they are a part of my identity.

				<outline text="Too Much Religion" created="Mon, 29 Jul 2024 14:21:30 GMT" type="outline">
					<outline text="I am convinced that a problem, may be even &quot;the&quot; problem, is that there is too much religion in America, and people do not recognize this problem because they have a too narrow definition of religion. Religion is anything, usually a group of people or an institution, to which one identifies themselves with and is loyal to because they derive meaning from that group. For example, complete this sentence, &quot;I am....&quot;. " created="Mon, 29 Jul 2024 14:18:39 GMT" type="outline"/>
					<outline text="If you are like me you will find yourself making many &quot;I am ...&quot; statements that not only include faith-based groups like &quot;I am Christian&quot; or &quot;I am Muslim&quot; but also, &quot;I am a father,&quot; and &quot;I am a woman&quot;, and also &quot;I am a Green Bay Packer fan,&quot; and &quot;I am a NASCAR fan&quot;. For too many today, their answers are also &quot;I am a Republican&quot; or &quot;I am a liberal&quot; or &quot;I am a conservative.&quot; " created="Mon, 29 Jul 2024 14:22:02 GMT"/>
					<outline text="So many groups to which we bind our selves to and that which demand our loyalty. I think all of these religions, yes even the faith-based ones, tend to be practices of idolatry. My understanding of religion explains how &lt;a href=&quot;https://terrycowan.substack.com/p/a-smorgasbord?publication_id=827606&amp;post_id=147015258&amp;isFreemail=true&amp;r=3hbnj4&amp;triedRedirect=true&quot;&gt;Donald Trump has managed to change what it means to be an evangelical Christian&lt;/a&gt; to a person who supports Donald Trump rather than a person who believes in the divinity of Christ." created="Mon, 29 Jul 2024 14:24:50 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Jesus is not the founder of the religion known by 90% of the world as Christianity, that religion was founded by the Roman Emperor Constantine. Jesus founded a movement, a way from religion that demands our loyalty toward our true selves as kin of of the divine, the divine that simply is &quot;I am&quot;." created="Mon, 29 Jul 2024 14:30:17 GMT"/>

				<outline text="Read a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/podcasts/archive/2024/07/religion-happiness-faith-loneliness-spirituality-atheism/678945/?&quot;&gt;good interview transcript&lt;/a&gt; in the Atlantic between Arthur Brooks and Jerusalem Demasis on whether religion can make one happy. My theory about what ails us as a society is that we don't understand religion and that there is in fact too much religion, particularly relative to fifty years ago. People association religion to particular sets of beliefs, institutions, or higher power, but religion is whatever humans attach themselves to derive meaning and identity.

				<outline text="Today there are many things to which one can and does attach themselves to, and one of those most popular right now in the United States is political ideology, populism/Trumpism and progressivism. (Right/left, Republican/Democrat, conservative/liberal are variations of the theme. " created="Tue, 23 Jul 2024 21:11:25 GMT"/>
				<outline text="Most people do derive happiness through these attachments that given them meaning, but you should see here the problem. Happiness is dependent on externalities, and therefore we are conditioned to seek these things that make us happy. I think what you really have here in religions is idolatry. " created="Tue, 23 Jul 2024 21:13:49 GMT"/>
				<outline text="Religion does make one happy, in fact happiness , or feeling good about oneself, is practically the purpose of religion. The problem is in the belief that the pursuit of happiness is that which ought to be our motivation, it's a problem because as happiness depends on something outside of oneself, it is fleeting. " created="Tue, 23 Jul 2024 21:22:02 GMT"/>
				<outline text="Rather than happiness, I think one ought to focus on joy. Joy is a state of being, one chooses or is conditioned to be joyful, by which I mean joy is not dependent on a an externality, it comes from the inside out. Idols promise happiness, but they are finite. Joy comes from within one's soul, woven in to the fabric of who we are that is more than we comprehend. It's felt before known, but once known is infinite. " created="Tue, 23 Jul 2024 21:24:23 GMT"/>

It's always been an oligarchy veiled by a republic. The republican/representative democracy instituted by wealthy white men was immediately controlled by the invention of political parties, &lt;a href=&quot;https://teachingamericanhistory.org/blog/george-washington-on-political-parties/&quot;&gt;which Washington warned us about&lt;/a&gt;. It has taken more than 240 years for the system to evolve to where we are today that is completely controlled by wealth. The Presidency is simply the most powerful position in the world that money can buy and SCOTUS, which is the authoritarian branch of our fine government, made that official with the Citizens United and Trump immunity decisions.

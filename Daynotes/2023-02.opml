I expected it to, and it does.

				<outline text="I used &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview&quot;&gt;Github Codespace&lt;/a&gt; to make and test changes to &quot;PagePark&quot; for it to work with HTTPS. It's actually been working quite well. From what I can tell, Codespace creates a container running a version of Visual Studio Code that runs in the browser and clones the repo. To run pagePark all I did was open a new terminal window in Visual Studio Code and type node pagepark.js. The app thinks it is running on localhost (so you need a localhost domain for content for pagePark to server) and Codespace automatically generates a URL and forwards port 443 to whichever port (1339 or pagePark) that the app is listening on.

				<outline text="You use Visual Studio Code in Codespace like it is running on your computer, and you need to stage, commit, and push any changes you make to your code back to your repo using the git extension. I think I have just sampled a bit of what Codespace can do, but it basically provides a way to develop and test code all within a browser. The container is associated to the repo, and you create a Codespace using the Code button on the repo page. It looks like the Container spins down after being idle for about 15 minutes." created="Fri, 24 Feb 2023 19:55:54 GMT" type="outline"/>

					<outline text="On Wednesday &lt;a href=&quot;http://oldschool.scripting.com/frank.mcpherson@gmail.com/2023/02/22.html&quot;&gt;I wrote&lt;/a&gt; about my experience running my own instance of &quot;PagePark&quot; to provide browser access to the outlines that I maintain in Drummer. Previously I was relying on Dave's instance of pagePark that was integrated with Little Outliner and the prior version of Drummer. The integration broke in the move to version 2 of Drummer. " created="Fri, 24 Feb 2023 18:49:39 GMT"/>
					<outline text="In the recent past I experimented with getting pagePark to work with HTTPS, and got it to work by editing the template file that pagePark uses to render OPML to get pass the mixed type (HTTP/HTTPS) errors that prevented sites from loading in a browser. I originally used &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform&quot;&gt;DigitaOcean's App Platform&lt;/a&gt; for that work, but they charge to host web services and so when I was done I moved that work to Render.com, which will host &lt;a href=&quot;https://render.com/docs/free&quot;&gt;web services for free&lt;/a&gt;. Render is similar to how Heroku used to work. The catch is that Render spins down instances when they are not used after 15 minutes, but they automatically restart the instance upon the next request, and it takes about 30 seconds to start back up. The free service is good for development but is not intended for production sites." created="Fri, 24 Feb 2023 18:56:26 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Render builds a web site/service by building a container and cloning a Github repository, and it detects which type of web service it is and automatically installs that runtime in the container. I forked a copy of pagePark to my Github account and associated it to a new web service on Render, and during the build process Nodejs and npm are installed. I provided the build command (npm install) and the run command (node pagepark.js). Whenever I want to deploy a new instance, I just go in to the dashboard and click Manual Deploy, which triggers Render to create a new container, clone my repo, install nodejs and npm, build the app, and then run the app. " created="Fri, 24 Feb 2023 19:04:41 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I now have &lt;a href=&quot;https://pagepark.onrender.com/myStatus.opml&quot;&gt;my /now page&lt;/a&gt; loading with HTTPS via the instance of pagePark running on Render. (Note, there may be a delay when you click the link if the site has been spun down, a consequence of Render's free service.) I am mirroring the same file stored in Drummer that is also the source for the version &lt;a href=&quot;http://frankm.info&quot;&gt;that is only accessible via HTTP&lt;/a&gt;.  To make it work I had to do two things to &lt;a href=&quot;https://pagepark.onrender.com/template.txt&quot;&gt;the template&lt;/a&gt; that is defined for urlDefaultOpmlTemplate in config.json: I had to edit all of the URLs in the file to remove references to HTTP, which I did by replacing them with the format used by the new version of Drummer. I also had to comment out the div class divXmlIcon, which places the orange XML button on the page, because it is related to a script that pulls the icon file from a site via HTTP. " created="Fri, 24 Feb 2023 19:11:18 GMT"/>
					<outline text="If you look at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://pagepark.onrender.com/template.txt&quot;&gt;template file&lt;/a&gt; you will notice that the script src links are a mix of S3 buckets associated to fargo.io and scripting.com. Only two of the script src lines has pagepark in the path, and of course that script and CSS file is not needed for Drummer. Turns out that the same files are accessible from both locations, so I tried fargo.io first but then the files would not render. I then tried the scripting.com version, and boom, success!" created="Fri, 24 Feb 2023 19:23:10 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I am going to pause this work here and wait and see whether Dave officially adds support for HTTPS to pagePark. I'll keep what I've done on Render, but I am not going to pay $20 per month to keep an instance running on Render. All I think I should need now to get HTTPS working on my pagepark server is to add Caddy like I did for my wiki, but I am not sure whether that server has enough memory.

					<outline text="As far as I can tell, there are two points of integration between Drummer and Twitter. One is the ability to send a tweet from Drummer, which I think will go away due to Twitter's API change. One can send a post to Mastodon (look in Settings) but only via Dave's Mastodon server. The second integration is for identity authentication, and this item will have to be replaced in order for Drummer to continue functioning. I believe Dave has a plan, the clue though is in FeedLand and not visible in Drummer. FeedLand has an option under Tools to Connect with email. I anticipate that authentication to FeedLand, and in the future Drummer, will be like it is today with micro.blog, where you register an email address and provide that address when you log in from another device, which generates an email with a login link. When you click the login link a authentication token is dropped in the browser cache and you are able to access the application." created="Fri, 03 Feb 2023 19:37:54 GMT" type="outline"/>
					<outline text="Drummer is using Twither for OAuth authentication, which in my experience drops a cookie in the browser cache that persists until one clears the cache or logs out.

As long as the browser cache is in this state I should have access to Drummer even when Twitter shuts down the API because the only time the API comes in to play is when you first log in.

					<outline text="What will not work once the Twitter API closes is the ability to log in to Drummer on another computer or another web browser on this same computer. For this we will need Dave to change the method being used by Drummer to authenticate, and it appears to me he intends to do using email. Dave could switch to another OAuth provider like Github or Google, but the email method that micro.blog uses removes any dependency on another company, all Dave depends on is that his users have an email address. (What is not clear to me, even with micro.blog, is how one can change their email address and retain access. As long as one can log in, their ok, but if something really bad where to happen, I don't know what are the alternatives.). " created="Fri, 03 Feb 2023 19:46:10 GMT" type="outline"/>

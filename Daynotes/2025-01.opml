I find myself drawn to the concept but unable to invest in the amount of time it takes in re-writing the permanent notes. To me, notes are notes, and current technology ought to help with the connecting of the dots. My note taking system is really for storage and retrieval of information that I find useful or that I may need in the future. " created="Thu, 30 Jan 2025 14:21:34 GMT" type="outline"/>

					<outline text="I use Readwise Reader for reading web article, and in some instances when I read an article I may assign it a document tag. One way that I use these tags is to flag articles that could be a source for a blog post/essay. I've wished for a way to export just the tagged articles and today I realize that I have something similar already working with Obsidian." created="Thu, 30 Jan 2025 20:39:42 GMT" type="outline"/>
					<outline text="I have synchronization between Readwise and Obsidian so that all article, which come from Readwise Reader, and book (which come from Kindle) highlights are stored in my Obsidian vault. I realized today that the tags I am using appear in the Metadata section of an article that I highlight. The problem is that these &quot;tags&quot; in the metadata are not prepended with a hash (oddly, Readwise is using hash to flag categories rather than tags) but instead they are added as wiki links. If I click the &quot;tag&quot; link in one of the article documents a new file is added to my vault with that name and all of the articles with that tag are in the Linked mentions section of the document." created="Thu, 30 Jan 2025 20:44:29 GMT" type="outline"/>

The service is cheaper and would allow us to keep our home phone number, but the problem is that we only get one bar of cellular service at our condo. We have a microcell that we use to strengthen/enable our cellular connectivity. What would work for us, I think, is if the broadband VoIP was the primary connection then I would just put the device in the basement. What I really wish we could so is have our home phone number forwarded to both of our cellular phones, which enable us to preserve the number while decreasing our cost." created="Wed, 22 May 2024 15:00:20 GMT" type="outline"/>

				<outline text="New iPads: Deja vu All Over Again" created="Thu, 16 May 2024 14:32:24 GMT" type="outline">
					<outline text="I was mostly offline the last week as I on the road visiting family and friends. Catching up on my feeds, I see the reactions to the reviews of the new iPads that are predictable because they have been the same for the last five years or so now. All new iPad hardware is fantastic but hampered by the  operating system software. The real problem with these observations is that they are redundant and pointless unless one is reviewing a new release of iPad OS. " created="Wed, 15 May 2024 13:49:39 GMT" type="outline"/>
					<outline text="All technical reviews are opinion pieces. Ultimately, the author of the review is expressing an opinion about whether the product being reviewed is good or bad and whether the reader should buy the product or not, and I think it is the later point some people are reacting to.  Two types of readers/potential buyers exist, a small group of whom have never owned an iPad and another group that will considering upgrading from an older model to a new model. " created="Wed, 15 May 2024 13:54:03 GMT" type="outline"/>
					<outline text="The decision to upgrade is the tougher one because there are really few reasons to upgrade. The iPad Air I bought in 2020 runs everything I need it to run and will get the latest version of iPad OS when it is released. When I read in a review that iPad OS does not take full advantage of the hardware capability my simple translation is, it's not worth the money to upgrade. (Ironic side note, the iPad seems to be opposite of planned obsolescence and there seems to be a negative reaction, which makes me wonder whether we are too condition for planned obsolescence. ) " created="Wed, 15 May 2024 20:26:44 GMT" type="outline"/>
					<outline text="Should a person who does not own an IPad buy the latest one? The answer to that question is easier, if they have a need or desire for an iPad they should buy whichever model they can afford. None of the reviews I have read even consider recommending their readers buy an Android, Chrome OS, or Windows (Surface) tablet because it is generally accepted that the iPad is best tablet on the market.  " created="Wed, 15 May 2024 20:28:17 GMT" type="outline"/>
					<outline text="Finally, some of the reviews are really not reviews but instead editorials expressing ways in which Apple could improve the iPad or iPad OS. Editorials usually invite disagreement and so it is surprising when the authors of these articles are surprised by the disagreement as if they don't know they wrote an editorial rather than a review. If the same story is being written after every release of a new iPad, perhaps it's time for a different story." created="Wed, 15 May 2024 20:31:08 GMT" type="outline"/>

Normally Google waits for their annual developer conference to announce and ship the A-series phone, so the timing is curious. The Pixel 8a costs $499 and Google provides $200 on trade-in of the Pixel 7a that I bought last year. At the moment I have no plans to replace the 7a thought I bought last year, even though the 8a has the Tensor G3 chip." created="Tue, 07 May 2024 19:56:31 GMT"/>

				<outline text="Apple's 2024 iPad Announcements" created="Tue, 07 May 2024 19:54:55 GMT" type="outline">
					<outline text="Today Apple announced new models of the iPad Air and iPad Pro with associated new Magic Keyboards and a third generation Apple Pencil. Over the years my tablet usage has transitioned between Android, starting with the Nexus 7, and the original iPad, and recently back to Android with the Boox Note Air 3C. I bought the first iPad Pro that I ultimately replaced with the fourth generation iPad Air in 2020. I also have the iPad Mini 6 that I bought in 2022. " created="Tue, 07 May 2024 14:51:38 GMT" type="outline"/>
					<outline text="The main use case of the iPad Air has been for work, particularly writing notes in OneNote. The secondary use case for my iPad Air is watching video. Earlier this year I bought the Boox Note Air 3C that is a much better writing experience than the iPad + Apple Pencil so today I pretty much only use the Air for watching video. One other intermittent use case is for reading sheet music when I am asked to play at church, but that may only happen a couple times per year. Right now it is hard to find a reason to replace my current iPad Air with another &quot;large&quot; iPad model. " created="Tue, 07 May 2024 14:55:30 GMT" type="outline"/>
					<outline text="The iPad Mini is the most used of my personal computing devices. Prior to buying the Note Air 3C I did all reading on the iPad Mini, but even now I still occasionally read on it, and of course, if I needed to, I could write on it with the Apple Pencil. The Mini is good enough for video but it is not best suited for reading sheet music due to the small screen. " created="Tue, 07 May 2024 14:58:35 GMT" type="outline"/>
					<outline text="Apple did not announce a new iPad Mini, obviously they feel that given it is only two years old there is not a real need to upgrade the Mini. Frankly, I think Mini is the most intriguing of Apple's products in terms of what it will do in the future. Today the Mini and the current iPad use the A-series chips like the iPhone, in fact the current 10-th gen iPad uses the exact same A14 Bionic chip that is in my iPad Air. Does Apple want to continue with two chip series or consolidate to one? " created="Tue, 07 May 2024 15:01:05 GMT" type="outline"/>
					<outline text="Beyond spec upgrades like display types and processors, what else can Apple do to the iPad Mini? Perhaps make it thinner, but that too seems incremental. What seems most likely is a future Apple foldable that is about the same size as the Mini when folded, but I wonder whether the folding screen technology is good enough and affordable enough for that size of a screen? " created="Tue, 07 May 2024 15:06:28 GMT" type="outline"/>
					<outline text="Two constraints of the existing iPad Mini 6, the operating system and storage, would force me to replace my current Mini with a new model. My current Mini has 256 GB of storage of which I am only using 88 GB, so that is not close to being an issue. At some point Apple will stop supporting the Mini 6 in the latest version of iPadOS, but that isn't likely to happen for 3 to 5 years from now. " created="Tue, 07 May 2024 15:10:32 GMT" type="outline"/>
					<outline text="The Boox Note Air 3C has confirmed that my primary tablet use case is reading and writing, for which eInk displays are much better suited than the iPad. I could read sheet music on the Note Air 3C, I just haven't needed to try given I have the iPad Air. If I buy another IPad, it is more likely going to be whatever replaces the iPad Mini 6 or perhaps the current generation of the regular iPad.

				<outline text="Apparently writing and maintaining &lt;a href=&quot;https://defaults.rknight.me/&quot;&gt;a list of apps that one uses&lt;/a&gt; is a thing. Some folks are even publishing this info via RSS, although I am not sure that makes sense to me. A while back I created &lt;a href=&quot;http://tech.frankm.info&quot;&gt;a page of technology that I use&lt;/a&gt; that has a section I call Every Day Apps that maps to this use case. I see that I never completed that list nor put in links, so perhaps I'll spend some time updating." created="Thu, 30 Nov 2023 16:59:02 GMT" type="outline"/>
				<outline text="Seeing problems loading sites and web pages hosted by &lt;a href=&quot;https://micro.blog&quot;&gt;micro.blog&lt;/a&gt;. I know they have had back end server issues over the last several weeks. A bit ironic given that this morning I wrote a post singing my praises of micro.blog.

				<outline text="I've been using &lt;a href=&quot;https://read.readwise.io/&quot;&gt;Readwise Reader&lt;/a&gt; for more than a year and there are a few things I wish that it could do. One is that I wish it could provide me a report that showed me from which domains/sites I have read the most articles, which would tell me which of my RSS feeds are most valuable. I also wish it would be able to automatically categorize/tag inbound articles and then let me filter on those topics so that I could quickly read those articles.

Still not sure what was going on, there was a HP audio process taking a lot of CPU that I killed along with the Microsoft experience analytics process that I disabled. Microsoft Defender is constantly consuming 20-30% of the CPU and that alone causes the fan to nearly constantly run.  " created="Mon, 20 Nov 2023 14:43:17 GMT" type="outline"/>

I see that the standard repository has a update to the 5.15 kernel and I am wondering what will happen if I do a update? While the system revert to the older kernel version or stay at the newer?

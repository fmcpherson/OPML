Unfortunately, support for keyboard shortcuts is highly dependent on Javascript and that seems prone to breakage. It seems about every four months or so the keyboard shortcuts in Reader stop working, and we are in one of those phases. Right now I am seeing shortcuts disappearing just about every time I move from one article to the next, to restore them I have to reload the page. I've found the problem exists in Chrome and Firefox. I've sent feedback to Readwise so hope they fix this as they have fixed other occurrences. " created="Tue, 19 Dec 2023 18:47:41 GMT" type="outline"/>

It is sorted by percentage difference, but you need to look at the actual number of jobs created, which are in thousands.

				<outline text="I think the biggest consequence to &lt;a href=&quot;https://om.co/2023/12/11/microsoft-afl-cio-ai-deal/&quot;&gt;what Om predicts&lt;/a&gt; is a potential shift in how we direct young people toward professions that provide for a good life. (aka &quot;the American dream&quot;). When I grew up, and I think it is still the case, it was implied that the best professions, in most cases defined as the ones for which there is a greatest income potential, are white collar, which are the type of jobs at risk.  The attack on unions starting in the 1980's to just recently implied such &quot;blue collar/union&quot; jobs are &quot;less than&quot; non-union, white collar jobs. The huge wealth gap in the United States is a consequence of this direction, which has also transformed the U.S. economy from manufacturing to services. It appears that AI  has the potential to force a re-calibration of what we consider good jobs, ironically through the same automation that eliminated so many blue collar jobs during the last thirty years." created="Wed, 13 Dec 2023 16:55:17 GMT" type="outline"/>

Streams are designed to be &quot;subscribed to&quot; and more importantly kept current with, but I think it would be cool if stream developers provided a catchup format where the reader could specify a point in time to go back to and then the web app would present that content in a top-down format.

He cites as evidence the probability that SCOTUS will say the President of the United States is in fact above the law and notes that the Supreme Court has always been above the law.

					<outline text="Truth is, the norm of civilization on the Earth, which over time has been called different things but which can be simply stated as empire, has never allowed for liberty of everyone. Over the course of history different forms of government have existed and even those that claim to be democracies institute class hierarchies that provide liberty for some at the expense of others. Governments are institutions of humans and reflect our human dualistic view of the world. Governments are necessary and not particularly bad, but humans need to be self aware of our instincts and vigilant at guarding against them. " created="Tue, 30 Apr 2024 14:39:18 GMT"/>

I think such vigilance takes the form of placing core values above all others. " created="Tue, 30 Apr 2024 14:53:13 GMT"/>
					<outline text="One such core value is what does liberty mean? You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/liberty&quot;&gt;look up the word liberty in a dictionary&lt;/a&gt; and you will find several descriptions of what one may think of as freedom, but for me liberty boils down to my control over my body, which is exercised in many different ways such as to do as I please, to be free from restraint, and to decide what does and does not happen to my body.  A Supreme Court that is unwilling to recognize that liberty, which is intended to be enshrined by our founding documents, extends to women's right to decide what happens to their body is violating the core value of liberty.

Is a Supreme Court, or for that matter any member of Congress or President of the United States, that does not seem to know the definition of liberty or seeks to deny rights retained by the people acting in the best interests of the people as their representatives or are they acting in the best interests of their oligarch class?

					<outline text="It is true that the founders, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nypl.org/blog/2020/06/15/liberty-and-justice-all-platos-condemnation-democracy&quot;&gt;like Plato&lt;/a&gt;, were not fond of pure democracy and thus created a republic as a representative form of democracy. The founders were also not fond of the authority of the monarchy they just fought a war against, and so they created a system of government intended to preserve the best features of democracy while preventing against  tyrannies be they of individuals or classes. Among but not limited to these features are the unalienable Rights of Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. (Note the similarity between the Declaration and the Ninth Amendment) Beware of attempts to throw out democracy in the bathwater for that is language the political party oligarchs use to claim liberty for themselves at the expense of others.

If we were to write the Constitution today we might not even include emolument clauses in it because they have become such a part of everyday life. The other side of that coin, however, is that everyone in our capitalistic society knows full well that when one person or one committee or one corporation writes a check for thousands, hundreds of thousands or more dollars to a politician it is done with the expectation of something in return.

Huge election donations and lobbying come with expectations that effectively buy votes, but we don't think of this as corruption, at least not legally. However, I don't know how anyone can deny that huge part of our lack of trust in the institutions of government, or media (journalism), or medicine, is not due in large part to an awareness of how much influence on decisions is being bought. The growing lack of trust in government is the corrosion (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etymonline.com/search?q=corruption&quot;&gt;corruption&lt;/a&gt;) of the Republic in plain sight. (Further, if you think about it, much of the lack of trust in Biden or Trump is due to money!)" created="Tue, 02 Apr 2024 21:01:10 GMT"/>
					<outline text="The founders of the United States knew full well the affect emoluments can have on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://mises.org/mises-wire/stop-saying-were-republic-not-democracy?gad_source=1&quot;&gt;republic&lt;/a&gt;, which is why they included &lt;a href=&quot;https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF11086#:~:text=The%20purpose%20of%20the%20Domestic,to%20exert%20influence%20over%20him.&quot;&gt;clauses in the Constitution&lt;/a&gt; to limit that affect. Unfortunately, the ideology of originalism says that literal words, not the meaning or intent, only matters. (Taken to its logical conclusion, originalism can mean that Supreme Court Justices could be replaced by AI.)  Originalists will say, Article I, Section 9, Clause 8 only has the words &quot;from any King, Prince, or foreign State&quot; and there is no such prohibition of emoluments given from citizens of the United States, even if the very thing that clause was intended to prevent, which is the corruption of the government through quid pro quo, is what is happening." created="Tue, 02 Apr 2024 21:08:04 GMT"/>

					<outline text="Over the course of history we have accepted precedent that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/topic/First-Amendment/Permissible-restrictions-on-expression&quot;&gt;limits can be placed on free speech&lt;/a&gt; when it does harm to others. In my opinion, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/citizens-united-explained?ref=foreverwars.ghost.io&quot;&gt;the SCOTUS Citizens United decision&lt;/a&gt; makes that precedent murkier because it expands speech to spending money. " created="Tue, 02 Apr 2024 14:08:20 GMT" type="outline"/>
					<outline text="The problem with equating money to speech is that money corrupts. Consider, why is it that there is such lack in trust with news organizations? We know that all of the major news organizations are owned by corporations and we know that corporations primary objective is to make their owners money. Consequently most people expect news organizations to bias their reporting toward what makes money; whether or not this true doesn't matter, the widely held perception corrupts trust in news organizations. " created="Tue, 02 Apr 2024 14:12:08 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Every institution and its participants in the United States uses money, and perception exists that the institutions and participants will do anything for more money. A good amount of the lack of trust with institutions is caused by money, and the lack of trust in government is corroding democracy. Nearly everyone knows that lobbyists give money to politicians to get something back, this is a quid pro quo that common sense tells us is corrosive. Like rusty pipes, corrosion left unchecked leads to failure, in this cause failure of democracy." created="Tue, 02 Apr 2024 20:08:23 GMT"/>
					<outline text="The founders of the United States knew of the corrosive nature of purchasing favor from elected officials, although they appeared most concerned about quid pro quo with foreign governments. The Constitution has &lt;a href=&quot;https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF11086#:~:text=The%20purpose%20of%20the%20Domestic,to%20exert%20influence%20over%20him.&quot;&gt;three emoluments clauses&lt;/a&gt;: foreign, domestic, and ineligibility. Originalists will avoid the purpose behind these clauses and therefore not see how money spent by lobbyists is an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/emolument&quot;&gt;emolument&lt;/a&gt;, rather they will relate lobby money to free speech. " created="Tue, 02 Apr 2024 14:15:35 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Lobby money is quid pro quo of the same type as the founders feared at the time they wrote the constitution and I think they would expect us to recognize this and prevent it from happening, but alas nothing will be done because it requires action from the people who benefit from the status quou. SCOTUS upheld the Federal Regulation of Lobbying Act of 1946 in United States v. Harriss (1954); the act enables Congress to know &quot;who is being hired, who is putting up the money, and how much.&quot; Rather than prevent lobby money the act only shines light on who is giving money to whom. I wonder whether the founders would consider that sufficient in the spirit of the emoluments clauses they put in to the Constitution?" created="Tue, 02 Apr 2024 15:38:32 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Democracy in the United States is on the brink because rather than protecting it as defined in the Constitution, which means knowing and upholding its meaning, Presidents, members of Congress, and Supreme Court justices use original words to get away with as much as possible. The later is an ideology that leads a candidate for President (later elected President) to claim that Section 2 of the Constitution gives the President great power while the very purpose of the Constitution is to limit power.

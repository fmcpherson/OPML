				<outline text="My Smartphone Buying Strategy" created="Fri, 23 Aug 2024 15:45:26 GMT" type="outline">
					<outline text="Price for me is a big factor in deciding what smartphone to buy. I think $1,000 is too much to pay for a phone and $500 is my preferred high end. My preference is to pay less than $500 for a phone and I am willing to go over $500 by $200 if I am getting value in return. These prices are why I have been buying the A-series Pixel phones rather than the standard Pixel series. " created="Fri, 23 Aug 2024 15:26:41 GMT" type="outline"/>
					<outline text="Given price is a big factor, a correlating factor is trade-in value because that ultimately reduces the purchase price. Right now Google will give me $300 for trade-in of my Pixel 7a, which then brings the total cost of the Pixel 9 to $499 and the Pixel 8 to $399. What this means is if I wanted/needed the latest phone I could guy one within the price targets and I could buy last year's standard Pixel within my preferred pricing.  " created="Fri, 23 Aug 2024 15:30:04 GMT"/>
					<outline text="So then, then question becomes, is it worth replacing my one-year old Pixel 7a with either the Pixel 8 or the Pixel 9? The info I see says it's not worth upgrading to the Pixel 8 because all it provides is one generation newer processor and a slightly bigger battery, but worse camera specs. An upgrade to the Pixel 9 givens me much more: two generations newer processor, 4 more GB of RAM, a better ultra-wide camera, and finally support for the most recent Pixel features including AI. The better hardware is black and white, the value of the announced Pixel features and AI is gray at the moment. " created="Fri, 23 Aug 2024 15:32:52 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Consequently, wait-and-see is the best strategy. Based on the trade-in value of the Pixel 6, I expect Google to provide that same $300 trade in value for another year and in that time there could be a price drop on the Pixel 9. Most likely Google will drop prices, or have sales, at Christmas time. I expect Google will stop selling the 7a and should drop the price of the Pixel 8 to at least $599, and Google could drop the price on the Pixel 9 that in combination with trade-in on the 7a results in a more appealing price." created="Fri, 23 Aug 2024 15:38:26 GMT"/>
					<outline text="What I want to see is whether the new Pixel features that end up not available for the 7a  are really desirable. An approach is to wait until Google produces the Pixel 10 and drops the price of the Pixel 9, in other words, buying in on the N-1 Pixel. A factor is going to be whether Google continues the A-series. Rumors are they intend to drop the A-series and I fear the fact that they launched three Pixel 9 phones earlier in the year than normal lines up to that rumor. It would mean no new hardware at Google I/O and a summer release of new phones that are well in the supply chain for the upcoming holiday shopping season." created="Fri, 23 Aug 2024 15:41:39 GMT"/>

(They skipped the Pixel 8 for some reason). Interesting to me as a Pixel 7a owner to see the Pixel 7a overall multi-core score of 3,602 is not too much behind the Pixel 9 score of 3,885. The Pixel 7a single core score of 1,405 is actually better than the Pixel 9 single core score of 1,215. I wonder why the Tensor G4 is so poor at single core?

					<outline text="Because of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tomsguide.com/phones/google-responds-to-teampixel-controversy-that-would-cease-relationship-with-creators-that-preferred-other-devices&quot;&gt;Google #TeamPixel kerfuffle&lt;/a&gt; this past week, I had great interest in reading the reviews of the Pixel 9 series posted by &lt;a href=&quot;https://9to5google.com/2024/08/21/google-pixel-9-pro-review/&quot;&gt;9to5Google&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/24225221/google-pixel-9-pro-xl-review-ai-gemini-screen-battery-camera&quot;&gt;The Verge&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/review/google-pixel-9-pixel-9-pro-and-pixel-9-pro-xl/&quot;&gt;Wired&lt;/a&gt;. The gist of the kerfuffle is, can one trust reviews when associated with a &quot;#GiftFromGoogle&quot; tag in light of leaked text of the latest agreement with influencers that sets an expectation that non-Google devices are not &quot;preferred&quot; over Google devices? Google's later clarification is, they don't consider #TeamPixel as a reviewers program, and I think implied in that statement is an expectation that participating influencers are influencing on behalf of the brand. I personally wonder why anyone thinks this is news, it should be obvious that brands, Google or any other, see influencers as extension of their marketing. What is an influencer anyway?" created="Wed, 21 Aug 2024 18:17:37 GMT" type="outline"/>
					<outline text="Back to the original question about trust, I think a related question is about value. When I read official reviews I can't help but feel the writers feel obligated to write something, anything, negative about the product being reviewed, which makes some sense because what product is perfect. Except, is what one writer think a negative really a negative? I think what you see in &quot;tech reviews&quot; invariably amount to biases. What happens is that products are reviewed against a writers preferences and not against some form of industry, or even publication, standard. " created="Wed, 21 Aug 2024 18:23:23 GMT" type="outline"/>
					<outline text="So, I think one needs to take tech reviews with a grain of salt. Tech reviewers of &quot;recognized&quot; publications are not necessarily any better or ethical than influencers. Many reviewers put high value in access to products and people of these companies. Like nearly every other piece of journalism, reviews are a mashup of facts and opinions otherwise the reviews would be nothing more than a print out of product specifications. At one time, publications like PC Magazine had labs to do performance testing and published the results against an established baseline and their reviews tended to provide explanation of what the deviations from the baseline mean. Of course opinions crept in to the explanations, they weren't nearly 100% opinions. Most tech reviews you read today are not a report of a product measured against a baseline, but rather a report of a person's experience about using the device and whether that experience met their expectations. (More like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Pournelle#Computing_at_Chaos_Manor&quot;&gt;Chaos Manor&lt;/a&gt; and less like Byte Labs) The value of these reviews then depend on the degree to which the reader and the writer's expectations align." created="Wed, 21 Aug 2024 18:27:00 GMT" type="outline"/>

					<outline text="I am a lifelong fan of the Chicago Cubs and feel blessed to have lived long enough to see them win the 2016 World Series.

					<outline text="Last night Javier Baez, one of those on that 2016 who now plays for the Detroit Tigers, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bleedcubbieblue.com/2024/8/21/24225130/cubs-tigers-recap-cody-bellinger-javier-assad-mlb-scores&quot;&gt;returned to Wrigley Field&lt;/a&gt; for the first time since he was traded to the New York Mets. Even when Baez played for the Cubs he was not considered a good hitter, he chased most pitches out of the strike zone, but some time had the good fortune of making a big hit. I always felt Baez's value was most defined by his fielding at shortstop, and in his prime I thought him the best shortstop in baseball. I am old enough to remember that the shortstop position was not usually fielded by the best hitters (remember Shawn Dunston?), but considered the most important in field position and Baez fit that mold. " created="Wed, 21 Aug 2024 13:57:14 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Even though I did not like the fact that the Cubs seemingly unceremoniously dumped those players from the 2016 roster, I have to admit that looking back now nearly all were the right decisions, except for one, the first one letting Kyle Schwarber go as he went on to win another Word Series with the Nationals and play in another with the Phillies.

" created="Wed, 21 Aug 2024 14:02:05 GMT"/>
					<outline text="So, the front office was right in letting these players go for as many prospects they could get. Some, like Pete Crow-Armstrong, who they got in the trade to the Mets for Baez, has potential to be stars in their own right. My fear though is that the current Cubs front office has a profile for  players that seem to be one hit wonders over long term producers. In short, the new guys they get are like the old guys they had and that seems to produce the same results of not being good, nor clutch, hitters. You combine this hitting profile with a tendency turn over the bullpen every single off season and you get the mediocrity that is the current adjective for the Chicago Cubs.

First I ran it in the Fedora 39 LXC Container in Proxmox 8.2 on the Raspberry Pi 5 and compared that to the Debian 12 LXC Proxmox container running on the Beelink U59 Pro and the results support the better performance that I have been observing. This comparison is a bit apple to oranges given the different Linux distros, but I think it generally supports the notion that the ARMv8 processor used by the Pi is slightly better than the Intel N5105 even though the Intel processor has a slightly higher clock speed. The performance of the Fedora 39 container is nearly the same as as the Raspberry Pi OS, and in fact the single core score is slightly better. " created="Mon, 19 Aug 2024 20:09:54 GMT"/>

From a simple spec and performance perspective the EliteDesk is more than twice as fast in single core performance and a 5 times faster in multi score performance and I paid less for the EliteDesk, even though it is physically much larger.

I've heard the question, &quot;what is a photo?&quot; being raised, implying a definition of a photo as a graphical capture of a real moment. The introduction of AI tools that allow one to alter photos from something that really &quot;happened&quot; to something that didn't is what is being considered a problem. Except, what about how Photoshop has been used all these years? Presumably, people see editing a photo to improve it is different, but that editing can turn into a photo of something that did not happen. What about Google's Magic Eraser?

					<outline text="The judge has found Google to be a monopoly in a very specific market, and so the remedies that ought to be decided on should be intended to restore competition in that market.

I do not think breaking up Google would have any affect of restoring competition in the text ad in web search results market. Note that such a remedy would not prevent a company like Apple to continue to use Google as the default they just wouldn't get paid by Google to do so, and I wonder whether not allowing Google to be selected as the default for a period of time would be more harmful to Apple or Mozilla than Google.

					<outline text="I could have just left the Raspberry Pi OS on that board and connected to it with VNC or RDP, but I wanted to try out Proxmox on the Pi 5 to see how it would perform, which I have done. Given that the Raspberry Pi 5 uses an ARM processor, that limits what one can run on it to virtual machines or containers supporting the ARM (aarch64) architecture.

					<outline text="The Debian container has 2 vCPUs whereas the new Fedora 39 container has 4 vCPus, so I wondered whether adding 2 more vCPUs would make a difference, and it did, increasing the score to 3.73 from the 2.63 score I had seen previously.  I next installed Chromium on that Debian desktop, ran Speedometer 3 again and it got a score of 4.73! " created="Mon, 05 Aug 2024 21:08:25 GMT"/>

Unfortunately, I can't seem to get any Debian ARM LXC template provided by Proxmox to work on the Raspberry PI, so that means I will have to provision a Fedora container on the Beelink, which I will probably do and  install XFCE and Tigervnc on it to see what results I get." created="Mon, 05 Aug 2024 21:15:58 GMT"/>

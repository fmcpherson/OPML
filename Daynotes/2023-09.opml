				<outline text="The Raspberry Pi5 has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/introducing-raspberry-pi-5/&quot;&gt;been announced&lt;/a&gt;. I did some quick, back of napkin math and the 8 GB model with case and 25W power supply will cost $102. I  would most likely also buy the M.2 HAT but there is no price announced for it and it won't ship until 2024. The case now includes a fan and appears to be designed with space to accommodate the HATs provided by &lt;a href=&quot;https://raspberrypi.com&quot;&gt;Raspberrypi.com&lt;/a&gt;. A new version of Raspberry PiOS is also being released." created="Thu, 28 Sep 2023 15:16:06 GMT" type="outline"/>

I also have blogs on Wordpress that frankly have been dormant. Dave recently added &lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.scripting.com/?verb=wordpress.connectViaOauth&quot;&gt;Wordpress verbs&lt;/a&gt; to  DummerScript that I am interested in trying out. Problem is that as far as I can tell there are no example scripts, clearly it's a work in progress. " created="Wed, 27 Sep 2023 14:42:23 GMT" type="outline"/>

I think that the Focus modes make more sense for smartphones than tablets, but then the iPad Mini 6 is a bit more like a phone.

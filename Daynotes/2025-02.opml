					<outline text="I use the Logitech MX Keys keyboard that is a near standard keyboard with a numeric keypad. By near standard I mean that in between the QWERTY keyboard and numeric keypad is a section of keys for page up, page down, home, end, insert, delete, and arrow keys that is not recognized in Chrome. I have to un-lock the numeric keypad and use the equivalent functions on it. However, this behavior does not exist when I am in the Readwise Reader app, in that app (browser tab) the &quot;middle&quot; Page Up and Page Down keys work and the numeric keypad is always numbers no matter when or not it is locked.  I've also found that the Page Up/Down sequence of Command+Up Arrow and Command+Down Arrow doesn't work from the Mac OS client on the Macbook Pro, which I find really surprising." created="Mon, 10 Feb 2025 21:18:06 GMT"/>

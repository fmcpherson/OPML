I know the history and I had a blogroll on my blog back in the day and then Dave released Radio Userland, which was my first exposure to RSS and from that point on I no longer saw the need for blogrolls. I really don't want to back to the old form of loading one's web site to see their latest writing, I would rather have that writing pushed to me via RSS.

				<outline text="I am still trying to figure out why some keyboard shortcuts in Readwise Reader are not working consistently. I notice this mostly with the shortcut for highlighting, which is the H key. Oddly, not all shortcuts stop working and I can restore the functionality by reloading the page. How this appears is after reading an article, I press E to archive and move to the next article, then when I try to highlight a paragraph I press H and nothing happens. I reload the page and then press H and the paragraph is highlighted." created="Thu, 29 Feb 2024 16:13:17 GMT" type="outline"/>

				<outline text="I use virtual machines hosted with Proxmox as remote desktops that I access using the Microsoft Remote Desktop app in Windows 11.

It can get to the point at which as soon as I connect it disconnects. I've seen similar behavior with VNC. I am starting to think this is something to do with Windows 11 rather than the VM or the computer hosting it because I can connect with no problems using RDP on my Macbook.

				<outline text="I've been receiving many &quot;offers&quot; from AT&amp;T lately trying to get us to drop our landline and convert it to AT&amp;T's VoIP service. My speculation has been that AT&amp;T wants to get rid of landlines as it is probably costing them money, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/att-landline-california-complaints/&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; about what is going on in California appears to support that speculation. One of the single biggest problems I have with VoIP is with what happens when there is a power loss. Landlines continue functioning when the power goes down, Internet connections do not unless you have a UPS, and even if you do that could be for a short amount of time. The article states that AT&amp;T already received relief of its &lt;a href=&quot;https://readwise.io/reader/shared/01hp2tc6m7xgxrbycgx6b0svk1&quot;&gt;Carrier of Last Resort&lt;/a&gt; obligation in Michigan.

					<outline text="Despite &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2024/the-apple-vision-pro/&quot;&gt;reading more about the Apple Vision Pro&lt;/a&gt;, I have yet to warm up to the idea of strapping a headset on to my face, no matter the potential cost of the headset and the utility. I think back to the idea of one using notebook computers in meetings, many think that is rude or at the least too intrusive. While one can clearly take more detailed notes, there is a physical screen between oneself and other meeting participants. In this case tablets are more favorable because they can lie flat on table and be no more intrusive than a pad of paper.  " created="Tue, 06 Feb 2024 15:41:48 GMT" type="outline"/>
					<outline text="While the Vision Pro does have a pass through mode that enables the wearer to see what is in front of them, it is obvious to others in the room that the wearer's attention is not fully on them. Anything physically larger than regular glasses is going to send signals to others, just like the use of notebook computers in meetings and classrooms. Consequently in it's current incarnation the Vision Pro is a very private device." created="Tue, 06 Feb 2024 15:44:50 GMT" type="outline"/>
					<outline text="It's true that over time the use of notebook computers has become more accepted and it happens now in nearly every meeting and probably every class in college, but that still doesn't make it right. When Google first released Glass the debates about the social norms for their use started but never ended because the product really never gained acceptance, these social discussions, and probably laws, will need to restart. For example, I think it is worth serious discussion about whether one should ever be allowed to wear the Vision Pro on a plane, which is a place in which ones attention can mean life or death. Most expect Vision Pro to succeed mostly because it is from Apple, but even Apple is not immune to flops. " created="Tue, 06 Feb 2024 15:47:04 GMT" type="outline"/>
					<outline text="So, then, the question is at what price point and for what utility will the Vision Pro gain acceptance? Do you spend $1,000 or more on monitor on you desk? Some do, most do not. I think the price is going to have to be closer to $500 in order to generating real sales. I have no doubt that will happen, just like how 4K desktop monitors are affordable and thus dominant in sales. How long will it take for the price to come down, and might that be too long for the Vision Pro to gain acceptance? Money may be on Apple's side, but we will see whether time is too." created="Tue, 06 Feb 2024 15:48:28 GMT" type="outline"/>

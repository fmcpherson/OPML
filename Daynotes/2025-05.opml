				<outline text="I got Feedland &lt;a href=&quot;http://oldschool.scripting.com/frank.mcpherson@gmail.com/2025/05/30/204357.html&quot;&gt;running in my home lab&lt;/a&gt;, but why did I bother with it? Besides the obvious to find whether I can, one of the main reasons is to use it for managing my RSS subscriptions. Over time many of the sites I add to my subscription list stop being updated and it seems like a good idea to remove those sites from the subscription list and therefore cut down on the number of unnecessary updates being made by my feed reader. Feedland provides a nice view of all my feeds sorted by when they were last updated, so I can go to the bottom of the list and remove sites that haven't updated in a year or more. " created="Sat, 31 May 2025 15:41:52 GMT" type="outline"/>
				<outline text="Right now I am using the public version of Feedland to check for updates at the beginning of the day, then throughout the day I use River5. The feeds are organized differently in Feedland than River5 and that makes it easier for find older updates. River5 displays new items in a reverse chronological order so it's great to see the latest updates over the last several hours,  but I find Feedland a bit easier to use go back in time more than four hours. I just feel using the two provides me the best way to keep on top of everything. I also have River5 running locally and that server is in my Tailnet so that I can access it remotely. Now that I have an instance of Feedland running that I know will be available so longa s I keep it running, I might transition to using just it.

				<outline text="One thing that I am interested in is using Feedland for linkblogging. I have used Radio3 for that but when I settled on a more direct way of adding articles to Readwise Reader for later reading I stopped using Radio3. As long as Radio3 is hosted by Dave it's a risk of being taken down, so using something else for a linkblog, if I want to even build a linkblog, is a good idea.

				<outline text="Running Feedland Locally" created="Fri, 30 May 2025 20:43:57 GMT" type="outline">
					<outline text="Here is a quick write up of how I got Feedland running in my home lab. Feedland is hosted using two LXC containers running in Proxmox, one is running mysql and the other is running feedland. After provisioning the mysql container using the PVE Helper script I logged in to the database as root and created the database, tables, and indexes using the SQL provided in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/feedlandInstall/blob/main/docs/setup.sql&quot;&gt;the Feedland install instructions&lt;/a&gt;. I then created a new mysql user with read/write access to the feedland database for use in config.json of the feedland app." created="Fri, 30 May 2025 20:44:14 GMT"/>
					<outline text="The second LXC container is running Debian 12 and I installed the latest version of nodejs. I then downloaded the Feedland install zip file, expanded it and copied the required files in to the ~/feedland directory. I then went about editing config.json to align to my configuration. " created="Fri, 30 May 2025 20:58:37 GMT"/>
					<outline text="At first I tried configuring Feedland to use IP addresses for domain names hoping that would work but I could not get any browser I have to access the site, no matter the configuration. When I requested the site with the web console open the request appeared to redirect to https for access so fast I couldn't see anything appear in the console, so I then proceeded to configuring for access using https. " created="Fri, 30 May 2025 21:00:43 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I have a handful of web applications running in my home network that are accessible over https via nginx. The key to how that works is using Duckdns.org for hosting the DNS A record of the IP address of a server running on my home network and nginx knows how to configure and use Let's Encrypt with Duckdns to provision, update, and store the SSL certificates. The IP address is local and accessible via the Internet so the URL will only properly resolve when I am at home or connected to my home network via VPN, which is why the nginx and Duckdns integration is important for authorization and provisioning of the SSL certificate by Let's Encrypt. I have minimal knowledge of Nginx and use the web app to configure it. Unfortunately, I couldn't figure out how to make websockets work and I would see errors reporting that the app can not communicate with the server. At this point I decided to install and use Caddy in the Debian 12 container running Feedland so that I could use the example configuration provided in the Feedlandinstall repo." created="Fri, 30 May 2025 21:03:38 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Next I had to figure out how to make Caddy work with Duckdns, which requires running Caddy with a Duckdns module that one installs using xcaddy. I found xcaddy requires the latest version of Go, which I installed and eventually got the  Duckdns module installed for Caddy. To proxy the URL and handle SSL I had to add a tls section to the Caddyfile to specify using duckdns for the DNS and provide the Duckdns API token for authentication. The steps I followed are available in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.byteninja.net/caddy-web-server-with-duck-dns/&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; about using xcaddy and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.byteninja.net/caddy-ssl-reverse-proxy/&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; about configuring Caddy to use Duckdns." created="Fri, 30 May 2025 21:10:00 GMT"/>
					<outline text="One final piece to get Feedland running was to configure it to use Wordpress for the identity management. I briefly looked at the Email configuration and got a confused by the instructions for AWS SES so switched to using Wordpress. " created="Fri, 30 May 2025 21:17:15 GMT"/>
					<outline text="All of this worked and I could load Feedland and log in but every attempt to do something, like add a feed, resulted in &quot;Unable able to communicate with the server&quot; errors. I saw in the browser console that there were mixed content errors occurring. The resolution was adding the a value for urlServerForClient such as &quot;https://feedland.example.com/&quot;, being sure to include the slash at the end. I found this out by reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/feedlandInstall/blob/main/docs/config.md&quot;&gt;the config explanation&lt;/a&gt; but this value is not in the default config.json included in the file nor was there any mention about it in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/feedlandInstall/blob/main/docs/https.md&quot;&gt;the instructions regarding using HTTPS&lt;/a&gt;. Before setting this value calls were being made to the myDomain value using http. " created="Fri, 30 May 2025 21:18:36 GMT"/>

					<outline text="The solution to the on-screen keyboard usage issue is to install the Google Gboard keyboard from the play store. I configured it to use the split keyboard that moves the left and right sides of the keys toward the left and right sides of the display. The space bar is much wider and the auto correction works just as well as on my Android phones. All of this makes for as good a typing experience on the Go 7 as with any other device I use." created="Tue, 27 May 2025 14:53:37 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Boox sells a stylus that works with the Go 7 that costs $50, but that is not yet available to order in the United States. Fortunately, the Go 7 supports &lt;a href=&quot;https://universalstylus.org/the-universal-stylus-initiative-releases-version-2-0-of-its-popular-active-stylus-specification/&quot;&gt;USI 2.0&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Stylus_Initiative&quot;&gt;Universal Stylus Initiative&lt;/a&gt;), which means other branded USI 2.0 styluses should work and I bought &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DP8BK4SZ&quot;&gt;this cheaper one&lt;/a&gt; on Amazon. Unfortunately, it now looks to be out of stock. " created="Tue, 27 May 2025 14:57:48 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Stylus input and thus handwriting on the Go 7 is not very good mostly because the nib of the stylus is a hard plastic and you are writing on a glass screen. You have a similar experience writing on the Apple iPad using the Apple Pencil except that latency and pressure sensitivity is better with the Apple Pencil than most USI 2.0 styluses. In my opinion, because the handwriting capability is not going to be very good it's not worth spending a lot of money on a stylus. In fact, you really don't need the stylus to use the Go 7, which is why one is not included. " created="Tue, 27 May 2025 15:04:59 GMT"/>
					<outline text="One final issue to report, as this Boox Go 7 has a monochromatic screen colors in apps are &quot;translated&quot; to different shades of black and in some instances the results are not very good. An example is Google Keep, note text displays pretty good but tap the add button to create a note and you see a dark background and black buttons but not text because it appears Google has dark text on those buttons. What I had to do is optimize the app, select Other Colors, and increased the Webpage Text Color to 20." created="Tue, 27 May 2025 15:07:35 GMT"/>

He also seems at a loss for what could have been done differently. I think there is one thing that could have been done differently, one lesson that should be learned from COVID, which is that disasters are no place for politics. We must have a point at which we are willing to see there is a common enemy and work towards defeating it. In my opinion too many of those 1.2 million Americans lost their life because of people too caught up in the blame game and got ya politics.

					<outline text="My interest in the Go 7 was piqued when I learned it has a seven inch screen, supports stylus input for handwriting, and cost $249. The downside is that the stylus is not included and that it doesn't use the Wacom EMR input as used on the Note Air 3C, which means the stylus has to be charged and the writing feel is going to be &quot;plastic on glass&quot; such as exists with the iPad. " created="Wed, 21 May 2025 17:50:04 GMT"/>
					<outline text="The reasons to buy the Boox Go 7 are the resolution of the screen, how fast the screen refreshes, it's ability to run any Android app, it's size, and it's price. The Go 7 display is based on &lt;a href=&quot;https://electronics.howstuffworks.com/gadgets/high-tech-gadgets/e-ink.htm&quot;&gt;e-Ink&lt;/a&gt;, which is intended to look like paper and does not have back lighting. Text and pictures are drawn by applying an electrical charge to move micro capsules up or down and electricity is not needed to keep showing what is on the display, which means e-Ink displays use much less power than the LCD and OLED displays used by all other devices." created="Thu, 22 May 2025 14:37:09 GMT"/>
					<outline text="When e-Ink was first introduced in the mid-90s the speed at which display changes was noticeably slow. The slow refresh was tolerable for reading a book but if you flipped through the pages of the book quickly what you would see is a blur of changes as it started to draw text and then be disrupted by the page turn and the need to draw different text. " created="Thu, 22 May 2025 14:49:56 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Even with slow refresh rates, the low power consumption of e-Ink coupled by the fact the displays are much easier on eyes because one is not starting at a panel light, made e-Ink desirable despite it's limitations and that lead to the success of Amazon's Kindle and competing products from Kobo and Barnes and Noble that are designed for reading books. People who bought these devices did so for the sole purpose of reading and had no expectation for playing games or watching video." created="Thu, 22 May 2025 14:54:25 GMT"/>
					<outline text="The display of the Go 7 is much more advanced than the the one in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CFPJYX7P?ref=erdcatpage_fam_sa&amp;th=1&quot;&gt;Amazon Kindle Paperwhite&lt;/a&gt; or Barnes and Noble Nook. I can quickly flip through books or load web pages and scroll them up or done and see legible text. Text display is crisp and clear with the 300 DPI resolution and you can see higher resolution pictures and even video although the refresh rate, refresh rate, and lack of back light does not make for a good experience for watching video. " created="Thu, 22 May 2025 14:58:00 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Unlike the Kindle, which exists for only to read e-books sold by Amazon, the Go 7 has the Google Play store and therefore one can install and run any Android app. Boox has their own UI for their tablets so one familiar with Android may not recognize the Go 7 and running Android, and in fact while Google is about to release version 16 the Go 7 runs version 13 of Android. If you have Kindle books all you have to do is install the Amazon Kindle app on the Go 7 to read them, but you can also install the Kobo, Nook, or even Bookshop.org app so you are not locked in to a specific e-book ecosystem.

On the one hand he has given up an alarming number of home runs over the last 10 innings that he has pitched, on the other hand most of those were solo home runs. It might be that Jameson is tipping pitchies, or it might be bad pitch selection or execution, but it is also the case that MLB is mostly all about home run hitting these days. By current baseball standards, the pitching staff holding the opponent to 3 runs or less puts the loss on the team's offense, the win on the opponents pitching. Shota also gives up a lot of home runs as did Kyle Hendricks in the past and my guess is the overall rate increase has more to do with changes in hitting and these style of pitchers.

				<outline text="In think in this era what is most important is pitchers not walking batters and not giving up a high number of hits.

Home runs alone is not necessarily the factor in wins and losses, it's home runes in comparison between the teams. The loss last night was not on the pitchers, it was on the Cubs hitting.

We seem to have forgotten that the founder's solution to &quot;no taxation without representation&quot; was a two house Congress representing the people, the House of Representatives, and the states, the Senate. Congress is seat of the government, the President is there to execute the laws passed by Congress, and the Supreme Court is there to be sure the laws are within the bounds of the Constitution.

The unwillingness to be bound by the Constitution and the brazen circumvention is to me an impeachable violation of Trump's oath of office.

Every season the Cubs rebuild their bullpen mostly from pitchers who were let go from other teams. When they do sign a free-agent reliever it is not when that person is at their prime but rather after their prime when they don't command as high a salary. Hoyer's plan for building a championship team is predicated largely on luck, but luck is not a strategy. No matter whether the Cubs win the division at the end of the season, Ricketts has only one question to answer and that is, based on his body of work, can Jed Hoyer build a consistently championship level competitive team? I think the evidence since 2017 is clear, he cannot and it is time for a change in direction. " created="Mon, 12 May 2025 14:40:27 GMT" type="outline"/>

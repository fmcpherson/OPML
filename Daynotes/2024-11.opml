					<outline text="I have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.la-z-boy.com/&quot;&gt;La-Z-Boy&lt;/a&gt; recliner that is the center of my &quot;man cave.&quot; The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_cave&quot;&gt;man cave&lt;/a&gt; is the basement of our condo, which also happens to be my home office during work days. Sunday night I sat down on the recliner and started falling backward, if I hadn't reacted I probably would have flipped myself and the chair over. Obviously, something broke, and my diagnosis found a part that looks like a clamp that attaches to a rod that runs across both sides of the chair had &quot;ripped&quot; and thus disconnecting what I assume looks like an arm that holds up the right back of the recliner when it's not reclined. When reclined the chair is perfectly stable." created="Tue, 26 Nov 2024 15:48:42 GMT" type="outline"/>
					<outline text="Yesterday I called the service department of the La-Z-Boy store from which we bought the chair seven years ago.

I did have to figure out how to switch the settings from the default for microphone and audio to speaker phone, but then was good to go. A switch of the camera to the rear facing one, a flip of the chair and pointing of the camera to the part I saw broken confirmed my diagnosis. All was left was to snap a picture of the label on the bottom of the chair and the replacement part will be ordered. " created="Tue, 26 Nov 2024 15:57:06 GMT" type="outline"/>
					<outline text="I now wait for another text to schedule the technician to come to the house to make the repair, once they have the replacement part, but right now I do not know how long we will have to wait. The virtual visit saved me the expense to have a technician come and diagnose the problem but not be able to fix it due to not having the correct part. I will still end up paying $160 to get the chair fixed, but I now am insured it will be fixed." created="Tue, 26 Nov 2024 15:59:52 GMT" type="outline"/>

				<outline text="My biggest issue with the Macbook Air has been that I found the 13-inch screen too small, so I am really happy that the 14-inch screen of this Macbook Pro is noticeably better. At one point I considered buying the 15-inch screen version of the Macbook Air, but now I am thinking that screen might actually be too large. I definitely was not going to get another 13-inch screen, which is why the price points between the two options I was considering were not too great. I think in the long run I am going to be really happy with my decision." created="Sun, 24 Nov 2024 17:45:08 GMT" type="outline"/>
				<outline text="I continue to be amazed by the experience I've had in moving all of my apps and data from the Macbook Air to the Macbook Pro, it very effective and effortless. The transfer did take a couple of hours via the direct WiFi connection between the two computers, which makes me wonder how that transfer would have worked if I had decided to pick up the Macbook Pro from the local Best Buy and trade in the Macbook Air at the store. Perhaps a direct cable transfer is faster? Otherwise I imagine I would have had to leave the computers with the Best Buy folks while I went home for a few hours." created="Sun, 24 Nov 2024 17:40:45 GMT" type="outline"/>

					<outline text="I took advantage of two Black Friday sales: Best Buy's $200 off the Macbook Pro and Google's $70 off the Pixel Watch 3. The Macbook arrived yesterday and the Pixel Watch arrived this morning. I stayed with the 41mm version but in Obsidian (black) with the black active band. Google has finally improved the Out Of Box experience for people who are replacing an old Pixel watch by providing the ability to restore from the backup of that watch. All the apps and settings of my Pixel Watch were properly restored to the Watch 3, whereas in the past I had to re-install of the apps." created="Sun, 24 Nov 2024 17:24:56 GMT" type="outline"/>
					<outline text="Not much differences exist between the Pixel Watch and the Pixel Watch 3. The bezel is slightly smaller, and that is slightly noticable but I honestly don't read much of the watch screen so I didn't find the old watch display too small. My only complaint so far is that the adaptive brightness is too dim in dark settings, but I am hoping that improves in time." created="Sun, 24 Nov 2024 17:30:37 GMT" type="outline"/>
					<outline text="Fortunately, the watch was delivered to the correct address. My past experiences with the Google Store have been bad in that what I ordered was delivered to the wrong address in the condominium complex I live in. I know that is more the fault of Google's shipper, FedEx, but after having both the Pixelbook and Pixel Phone 4a delivered wrong, I have been avoiding purchases Google. I bought the Pixel Watch from Best Buy." created="Sun, 24 Nov 2024 17:33:33 GMT" type="outline"/>
					<outline text="I had some reservation in buying this watch from the Google store, but Best Buy was not willing to provide the $50 trade-in value that Google is providing for the Pixel Watch, so I went ahead with the purchase. I felt a bit more comfortable during the order process when I was provided the option to specify whether I wanted signature required for delivery, and I selected that option. The problem is, while my request of signature required appeared in the confirmation of the order, that request did not transfer to FedEx as the watch was delivered without my signature! Fortunately, I received notification on my iPad that the watch was delivered so that I could immediately get it from the front door. In short, the ordering/delivery process from the Google store is still not correct, and so I continue to discourage its use. " created="Sun, 24 Nov 2024 17:36:00 GMT" type="outline"/>

				<outline text="I am considering replacing my Macbook Air with an Apple computer that has an M4 processor. While the M1 processor in my current Macbook Air is fast enough for most tasks, I know that it's processor and memory are limiting for LLM processing.

Consequently, if I stick with the Air line then I am only interested in the 15-inch model and any computer that I will buy will not have less than a 512 GB SSD, so that translates to the $1,499 M3 Macbook Air with 15-inch screen and 512 GB SSD. Most likely the M4 variant of that model Air will the same price. The 14-inch Macbook Pro with an M4 processor and 512 GB SSD is $1,599 and probably Black Friday deals will decrease that price to at or near the $1,499 mark.

There is a difference between being a politician and being politically smart. In this election Harris was the politician who in most cases was unwilling to take a stand for fear of being divisive. Trump was politically smart, willing to be make a clear stand about anything not really caring about whether he was divisive. Many people like him because he takes a stand, even if they don't agree with his position, and to them he comes across as very un-politician.

					<outline text="Ironically, I think a younger Biden was more like Trump than Harris, which is probably why he was not successful in earning the Democrat nomination when he was younger. For the sake of becoming President and for hope of remaining President Biden agreed to the will of the party. It's unfortunate that time caught up to Biden.

Part of why the left is so much &quot;louder&quot; now is because they are reacting to the &quot;volume&quot; of the extreme response. It's &lt;a href=&quot;https://spacecenter.org/science-in-action-newtons-third-law-of-motion&quot;&gt;Newton's third law of motion&lt;/a&gt; in politics.

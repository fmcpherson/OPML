				<outline text="I've read some common themes regarding &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.google/products/pixel/software-support-pixel-8-pixel-8-pro/&quot;&gt;Google's change to seven years of full support for Android on the Pixel 8 phones&lt;/a&gt;. The comments boil down to whether the hardware performance will keep up or whether people really use a phone for that long. (Others are skeptical that Google will live up the promise, but I think if they don't they will face lawsuits.) I think both are examples of missing the point. For me there is a difference between having the ability to use a phone that runs current software for more than three years and a circumstance where I must replace the phone after three years if I want current software. Most likely there will be new features in the Pixel 10 or 11 that make buying a new phone desirable but there is a big difference between wanting to buy a new phone and having to buy a new phone. I would be very surprised to find many people still using the Pixel 8 seven years from now, but it's nice to know they can if they want to." created="Wed, 11 Oct 2023 19:35:40 GMT" type="outline"/>

It makes sense that for a phone to be released in the spring there would be drawings available in the fall as manufacturing prep would have to be starting probably in December. Perhaps I am wrong about Google's plans for the A series, which then in my mind begs the question of just how many Pixel phones Google wants to be selling and supporting at any one point in time." created="Mon, 09 Oct 2023 19:28:56 GMT" type="outline"/>

				<outline text="Google announced the Pixel Watch 2 during the Pixel event earlier this week. I've been wearing the original Pixel Watch and the sports band it came with, for about a year. I am not planning to buy the Pixel Watch 2 so when I learned about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.spigen.com/products/pixel-watch-band-lite-fit&quot;&gt;the Spigen Lite Fit band&lt;/a&gt; I decided to buy it to change the appearance of what I have been wearing. The band is elastic nylon in a single loop with size adjusted by a buckle. I find the band is very comfortable to wear. One thing I have found is that charging the watch is now a bit more cumbersome because I can't just place the watch on top of the charging puck and let it magnetically snap in to place, instead I have to slide the puck underneath the watch and some times the alignment isn't perfect. Not sure whether &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/6/23906028/google-pixel-watch-2-wireless-charging-smartwatch&quot;&gt;the pins on the Pixel Watch 2 charger&lt;/a&gt; will make this alignment easier.

I note that the VM I built running Xebian never did fail even before the microcode and kernel updates, and as far as I can tell one of the main differences is that VM does not have any power saving settings enabled. My theory is that the &quot;default&quot; VMs I had been building had some power saving configurations that has issues. Regardless, I am happy the problem appears resolved." created="Fri, 06 Oct 2023 15:07:51 GMT" type="outline"/>
				<outline text="Forecasting the future. Right now the price breakdowns for the Pixel phones are, Pixel 8 at $699, Pixel 7 at $599, and Pixel 7a at $499. If you want lower you can get the Pixel 6a for $349. Sales often appear that provide even better prices, for example on Amazon Prime day I bought a Pixel 6 for $250. I expect that Google will drop the A series, and use the previous model Pixel as the lowest price models, which is what Apple does. Apple actually keeps two past years of phones on their store, so if Google were to do the same thing then next year the announce the Pixel 9, and drop the prices of the Pixel 8 and or 7 and stop selling the Pixel 7a.  I suspect we will learn whether this is true next spring as Google I/O 2024 approaches." created="Fri, 06 Oct 2023 13:47:12 GMT" type="outline"/>
				<outline text="If I am right about Google dropping the A series, I think they should announce that the Pixel 7 will get the same 7 years of updates so all their models have the same supported life span.  Financially this all makes sense except for the fact that as far as I know the A series has actually been the best selling of the Pixel line, most likely because it has all the right features in common with the more premium models at a lower price. In the past I preferred the A series because it was lighter, smaller, and cheaper, but given that the Pixel 7a is as large and heavy as the Pixel 7 those benefits no longer exist and the $100 lower price is not large enough when one makes the comparison I describe below." created="Fri, 06 Oct 2023 13:53:56 GMT" type="outline"/>
				<outline text="I bought the Pixel 7a this spring shortly after it was announced, but had I known that Google would be expanding to 7 years of OS support starting with the Pixel 8 I probably would have waited. I think the extra support along with the slightly better features justify the $100 higher price. Not that I am not happy with the Pixel 7a, but I think the Pixel 8 is a better value for the money and that I think is further evidence of the possibility Google will stop the A series.

				<outline text="Google's Pixel event last year was on this date. Reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://oldschool.scripting.com/frankm/2022/10/06/134744.html?title=googleEvent&quot;&gt;my notes from that event&lt;/a&gt;, I am reminded that the Pixel 7 had a 6.3 inch display  and is 6.1&quot; tall. The Pixel 8 has a 6.2 inch display and is just under 6 inches tall, so basically Google got the &quot;main&quot; Pixel under the 6 inch mark, which I am happy to see particularly if they decide to stop the A series. My Pixel 7a is actually a little bit taller than the Pixel 8 though it has a 6.1&quot; display.

				<outline text="Looking at &lt;a href=&quot;https://store.google.com/magazine/compare_pixel?hl=en-US&quot;&gt;a comparison&lt;/a&gt; between the Pixel 7a that I own with the new Pixel 8s Google announced yesterday. First thing of note is that the Pixel 8 is basically the same size as the Pixel 7a, which is good. The displays are basically the same though the 7a has one more PPI, but I think the big difference is that the Pixel 8 brightness can go as high as 2000 nits whereas &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gsmarena.com/google_pixel_7a-review-2573p3.php&quot;&gt;the max of the 7a is 1070 nits&lt;/a&gt;. If you use your phone bright sunlight a lot that alone may make you swap the phones. Battery capacity is a notch greater on the Pixel 8 than 7a, 4575 mAh versus 4385 mAh. The Pixel 8 has the third generation of Google's Tensor chip where as the 7a has the second generation. Lots of claims of how much more powerful the G3 is, but time will tell in terms of feature limitations. The other big question about the G3 is how it helps with battery life. The camera comparison is confusing, if you look at &quot;megapixels&quot; the camera on the 7a appears better, but I think the 8 has a better sensor and larger field of view that should make it a better camera. " created="Thu, 05 Oct 2023 15:48:10 GMT" type="outline"/>
				<outline text="It seems to me that the additional capabilities make the Pixel 8 worth the $100 higher price than the Pixel 7a. My recommendation between the two is to buy the Pixel 8. If you are too concerned about the price, you could wait for sales around Christmas time or earlier next year. I personally think Google should knock off $100 on the Pixel 7a to justify the purchase decision between it and the Pixel 8. A $150-$200 price difference would keep people from just skipping over it.

				<outline text="I think the biggest news of the Pixel 8 event was that &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.google/products/pixel/software-support-pixel-8-pixel-8-pro/&quot;&gt;Google will be providing OS and security updates for seven years&lt;/a&gt;. I wish Google would extend that level of support to the Pixel 7a that I bought earlier this year. However, I wonder if there will be a relationship between this new length in OS support and how long Google will sell the Pixel 8 in their store.  Right now Google is selling the Pixel 6a through the just announced Pixel 8 Pro in their store, that is seven different phones. I wonder how much longer Google will be selling the Pixel 6a and Pixel 7 phones. I don't know why someone woudld buy the Pixel 7 Pro." created="Thu, 05 Oct 2023 15:42:25 GMT" type="outline"/>

I thought the AI wallpaper personalization was going to be available, but I see that for now that is a Pixel 8 only feature. I will have to wait for a future feature drop. I don't get why Google feels it necessary to with hold software features like this as I find it hard to believe they drive hardware sales.

				<outline text="Pugnosticating The 2024 Chicago Cubs" created="Wed, 27 Mar 2024 17:48:47 GMT" type="outline">
					<outline text="The Chicago Cubs have completed the 2024 Cactus League spring training &quot;season&quot; and will start the 2024 MLB season tomorrow at the Texas Rangers. As many questions exist about the 2024 team as did for the 2023 team, so it is hard for me to expect them to be too much better than last year. Will Greg Counsell as the new manager make a difference? Perhaps that is the main question going in to this season. " created="Wed, 27 Mar 2024 17:48:57 GMT"/>
					<outline text="One cannot read much into what happens at spring training, although I attended spring training games in 2016, which is when the Cubs won the World Series, and have not attended a spring training game since nor have the Cubs returned to the World Series. Read in to that what you will." created="Wed, 27 Mar 2024 18:44:28 GMT"/>
					<outline text="For me what stood out most during spring training is that Seiya Suzuki continued hitting as well as he did in the second half of the 2023 season, and hopefully that will translate to a hot start for him in this season. Most Cub fans will say that Suzuki has not yet lived up to his potential, but we saw signs of that at the end of last year. I think it interesting that Suzuki may be hitting second to start the season so that he and Bellinger get as many at bats as possible during games. (Bellinger must bat no lower than third all season so he gets as many at bats as possible, something that David Ross refused to do last year.)" created="Wed, 27 Mar 2024 17:51:59 GMT"/>
					<outline text="The two biggest (or three biggest depending on how you count) questions for the Cubs going in to this season are, will Morel and Busch succeed at third and first base and how will the starting pitching perform? Morel will get his best chance to prove he can be a reliable third baseman and Busch will get a chance to prove that he can produce at the plate. The Cubs have been searching for the next players at third and first ever since they traded away Kris Bryant and Anthony Rizzo, and from fans' perspective that search has taken too long." created="Wed, 27 Mar 2024 17:56:17 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Many more questions exist about the pitching staff, but I think they start with will Jameson Taillon live up to expectations? Taillon was the Cubs big pitching pick up before the 2023 season and he did not pitch well and had several injuries. The fact that Taillon is starting the 2024 season on the injury list does not bode well. I think the Cubs need Taillon to meet expectations for them to have a chance to win the N.L. Central." created="Wed, 27 Mar 2024 18:00:52 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Will Justin Steele and Kyle Hendricks repeat their performances in 2023? We will find out soon given that Steele will pitch against the defending World Series champions on Thursday night and then Hendricks will follow him on Saturday. Finally, will Shota Imanaga meet expectations in his first season or falter as many players do when moving from Japan to the United States?" created="Wed, 27 Mar 2024 18:04:48 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Finally will the youngsters, Jordan Wicks and Javier Assad, improve upon their performances in 2023? The long term view for the Cubs relies heavily on their ability to promote pitching from within, and while Steele is a success story the MLB teams most successful over long periods of time have nearly their entire pitching staff come up from their farm system. " created="Wed, 27 Mar 2024 18:08:21 GMT"/>
					<outline text="The 2016 World Series team had an established pitching staff so going in to that season there were more questions about their hitting and fielding than pitching. The 2024 team has significant questions in all three areas, which means the probability for them to have playoff success, if they make the playoffs, is lower than in 2016. Given that the Cubs have a new manager it might be more fair to compare this team to the 2015 team that made it to the NL championship, which is the first year Joe Maddon managed the team. " created="Wed, 27 Mar 2024 18:12:42 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Despite the first year manager comparisons, I think it might be better to compare this team, or rather the entire Cubs organization, to the 2014 team. Back in 2014 many of their future stars were still in the minor leagues but on the brink of making it to the majors. During the 2024 spring training we saw many of the Cubs' future stars like Matt Shaw and Pete Crow-Armstrong perform well but sent back to the minors for further development. We probably will see some of those young players this season, but expect them to really push to start the 2025 season with the big team. " created="Wed, 27 Mar 2024 18:26:05 GMT"/>
					<outline text="The 2014 team finished with a 73-89 record but the 2024 team has better players and a better manager, so I do expect them to compete for the NL Central division championship in September. On paper the Cubs should take control of the division, but I am not confident the Cubs have enough consistent batters to prevent the team from having long losing streaks. I therefore expect the 2024 team to be about the same as last year's team. The main problem with how David Ross managed the team last year is that he kept players who were not hitting in the line up too long. I am not sure whether Counsell will have less patience than Ross had, but his impatience may be what leads the team to win the division. What I do know is that I am going to have fun watching to see how they do. Let's play ball!" created="Wed, 27 Mar 2024 18:32:38 GMT"/>

The article raises a concern that the elevation of computer science to the college level at universities may lead to students not gaining a broad education. I have a B.S. degree in Computer Science that I earned from &lt;a href=&quot;https://mtu.edu&quot;&gt;Michigan Technological University&lt;/a&gt; in 1989.  Back when I was in school Computer Science was a department under Mathematics.

				<outline text="One of the big challenges we have in the United States is that our founding documents that were written more than 200 years ago do not, because they could not, take in to account technological and society changes. Back when the Constitution was written there really was not a concept of &quot;national security&quot; in the manner as it exists today. Consequently, the founders never considered the risks of allowing &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2024/03/19.html#a133030&quot;&gt;a person to run for President who is deeply in debt&lt;/a&gt; and therefore could be tempted accept gifts from adversaries for access or favoritism.

					<outline text="&gt; Stern tells this story in “The Conflict Over the Conflict,” a work that is unlikely to please partisans. The book makes the case for bridging differences and recognizing nuance. It also describes Israeli-Palestinian history as an “ideal subject” to teach at universities, precisely because it is so divisive. At the West End Temple, Stern reiterated this belief. “On college campuses, students have an absolute right to expect they’re not going to be harassed, they’re not going to be bullied,” he said. “But to be disturbed by ideas is O.K.: we want students to be disturbed by ideas and to figure out how to think about them.”" created="Mon, 18 Mar 2024 18:57:39 GMT" type="markdown"/>
					<outline text="When I read what is written about campuses today I find it hard to relate to my own experience between 1984 and 1989. I think an in-depth study of what has happened to U.S. universities since the mid-80s may be illuminating.  One aspect that I recall from my experience that may be related is a focus on getting a degree in order to get a job. Even back then going to college was becoming less about growing up and becoming a more complete person but rather most students I knew were focused on the goal of obtaining a high paying job. In such a climate I can see where college not being a place where one is disturbed by ideas might be expected because that climate put no value on such a thing." created="Mon, 18 Mar 2024 18:51:05 GMT" type="outline"/>

					<outline text="Any day now we should see Apple announce new models to their iPad line of tablets and the announcement is highly anticipated because it was unusual of Apple to not announce new models during 2023. Even though the iPad has existed for more than a decade, there are still debates of its usefulness, mostly when framed in the context of replacing legacy personal computing devices that have keyboards, mice, and large monitors. " created="Wed, 13 Mar 2024 14:37:16 GMT"/>
					<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;https://realpersonalcomputing.com/2012/07/08/tablet-style-personal-computing/&quot;&gt;Twelve years ago I wrote&lt;/a&gt; about the tablet style of personal computing and its emphasis on simplicity and mobility, and I think what I wrote then still holds up. I've been a tablet user ever since Apple started selling the iPad, buying several models of iPads through the years along with Android and Chrome OS tablets. For a period of time I even owned a Windows Tablet PC &quot;convertable.&quot; " created="Wed, 13 Mar 2024 14:39:00 GMT"/>
					<outline text="In recent years I've mostly used two tablets, the iPad Mini (fourth through sixth generations), and the iPad Air (second and fourth generations). I am not typical in my ability and willingness to buy and use multiple models. The iPad Air is used for work related notetaking using OneNote and the Apple Pencil and for watching video, but I use the iPad Mini the most every day for reading eBooks and RSS feeds, reviewing email, and social networking. " created="Wed, 13 Mar 2024 14:45:19 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Over the years I've thought about what I would do if I only could afford one iPad, and given how often it used, that answer is the iPad Mini. I could write notes on it with OneNote if wanted and it certainly can play video. The one use case in which &lt;a href=&quot;http://oldschool.scripting.com/frankm/2022/04/20/141630.html?title=ipadMiniThoughts&quot;&gt;the Mini is not good is for sheet music&lt;/a&gt;, and for that alone I imagine hanging on to my current iPad Air for some time, but if I am to buy another iPad, which one? " created="Wed, 13 Mar 2024 14:49:29 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Right now the most likely answer is another iPad Mini, but I honestly find nothing wrong with the sixth generation that I am currently using and so I doubt I will be buying a replacement soon, except for one reason, which is that I could get enough trade in value on the iPad Mini 6 to make the replacement nearly a no brainer. Replacement value of iPads decrease as they age so it is reasonable to think how much Apple would pay today is greater than how much they will pay next year. " created="Wed, 13 Mar 2024 14:51:46 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Even still, given that the iPad Mini 6 is only two years old, I am wondering whether a new model will have enough changes to make it worthwhile. I honestly don't think an improvement in the screen is enough to entice me and I double that Apple will ever produce a Mini with an M-series chip, I expect Apple will also pair the iPad Mini with the higher end iPhone, A-series chips.  Most likely the new iPad Mini will come with the A16 BIonic chip that is used in the iPhone 14 and 15. " created="Wed, 13 Mar 2024 15:00:16 GMT"/>

Crossan describes the world view of Jesus as distributive justice, or perhaps &lt;a href=&quot;https://thinkingpacifism.net/2018/05/08/the-bible-violence-and-john-dominic-crossan-with-special-attention-to-the-book-of-revelation/&quot;&gt;Ted Grimsrud's term restorative justice&lt;/a&gt; is better. In Latin, Pax Christus. Jesus' teaching was built upon a very different understanding of God, as like a relationship between father and child rather than as dictator. Jesus taught in the tradition of the Jewish prophets who called out Israel's lapse into the norm of civilization and failing in its vocation to be a light for the nations. Israel failed to heed God's directive to not become like Egypt from which they were liberated. " created="Fri, 01 Mar 2024 16:00:08 GMT"/>
					<outline text="For me the shorthand for the norm of civilization is empire. You can look back through the histories of empire, including the most recent British and American empires, to see how the norm of civilization plays out. You see how even the United States came in to existence through the violence of revolutionary war, expanded its land through the violence of displacement of indigenous people, and continued its existence through the violence of a civil war. The American empire declared itself in the ultimate act of violence of atomic weapons dropped on Japan, and maintains existence through its current military and economic might.

					<outline text="It may be most obvious that empire derives its power through military and economic might, but less obvious but perhaps most important is that empire derives power by religion. Religion binds the adherents and victims of empire to a God they believe pre-ordains a group of people superior over others. What is most important to adherents of empire is a world hierarchical order, as God intended, so that there is peace, a peace that provides the adherents of empire the freedom to be as wealthy and powerful as they can imagine.

					<outline text="With the knowledge that empire, the norm of civilization, always seeks out and uses religion, it is understandable &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/08/viktor-orban-american-conservatism-admiration/671205/&quot;&gt;how some evangelical christians, Roman Catholics, and Orthodox Christians, align with dictators, real and would-be&lt;/a&gt;. In the world view of all these people they are simply striving for how everything is supposed to be, the norm of civilization and it's retributive justice and peace through violence. Those of us who grew up during the Cold War that pitted the American Empire against the &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://voicesofdemocracy.umd.edu/reagan-evil-empire-speech-text/&quot;&gt;evil empire&lt;/a&gt;&quot; of the Soviet Union find it mind boggling to see U.S. politicians, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2024/03/jacob-heilbrunn-america-last-trump-putin/677609/&quot;&gt;past Presidents&lt;/a&gt;, current members of Congress, and political pundits aligned to and in support of Vladimir Putin and Viktor Orban until we recognize how all these people are working to maintaining the norm of civilization." created="Fri, 01 Mar 2024 16:26:15 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Empire is always about enforcing the norm of civilization for the whole world. Over the centuries technology has expanded the definition of the whole world from regions to every square inch of the globe, thus empire aspires to truly rule the world, forcing would be empire builders to work with each other. Unfortunately, empire does not share power easily and therefore in a world in which nuclear weapons exist and economic power trumps climate change, empire building will always be a threat to our survival on this earth.

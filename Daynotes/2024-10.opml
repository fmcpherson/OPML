				<outline text="I am thinking about replacing my Macbook Air M1 next year. The current Macbook Air has a M3 processor and this week Apple has announced the M4 linueps of Mac Minis, iMacs, and Macbook Pros. Reporting is that the M4 Macbook Air will be announced early next year, probably to protect end of year sales of the new Macbook Prox. I am happy that Apple has decided on a 16 GB minimum of RAM, and I will not get anything with less than a 512 GB disk, but one of my dislikes about my current Macbook Air is that the 13-inch screen is too small.

				<outline text="Unless Apple changes the Air lineup, I will have to choose between a 15-inch Macbook Air or 14-inch Macbook Pro. The 15-inch Macbook Air with 16 GB RAM and 512 GB disk is $1499, the 14-inch Macbook Pro with 16 GB RAM and 512 GB disk is $1599. That Pro has a 10 core CPU and 10 core GPU, and has charging ports on the left and right sides, while the Air has an 8 core CPU, 10 core GPU, and charging ports only on the left side. I am thinking the additional 2 CPU cores and additional port is worth the extra $100, and I think I might prefer a 14-inch screen rather than the larger 15-inch screen." created="Thu, 31 Oct 2024 14:19:53 GMT" type="outline"/>

					<outline text="I upgraded my Pixel 7a to Android 15 yesterday and so far the two new features that I have enabled are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.droid-life.com/2024/10/07/androids-theft-protection-and-remote-lock-start-rolling-out/amp/&quot;&gt;Theft Protection&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/android/answer/15341885?hl=en#zippy=&quot;&gt;Private Space&lt;/a&gt;. The key to discovering both of these features is to go in to Settings and enter these feature names in the search box. Theft Protection is basically something you just turn on and not really use, whereas Private Space is something one actually uses. " created="Wed, 16 Oct 2024 14:58:52 GMT" type="outline"/>
					<outline text="The first thing to know about Private Space is that you need a second Google account that is not the primary one that you use with your phone so that what you store in the Private Space is not co-mingled. It appears that Private space is not just a set of hidden and secured file directories that stays on the phone, so be aware that some information you put it in syncs to Google. I already have a &quot;second&quot; Google account associated to my own domain so that is the one that I used. " created="Wed, 16 Oct 2024 15:02:29 GMT" type="outline"/>
					<outline text="The second thing I discovered is that there is not way to move an application and it's data that is already on your phone in to the private space. To move an app you have to install it in the private space, which you do using the second private space Google account and the Play store, then somehow move the data. A problem might be that an app you move may only be associated with your primary account. In thinking about Private Space, I am not sure whether it even makes sense as a place to store banking apps that already have its own authentication, Private Space is just an extra hop in that case. It seems really intended to be a separate area for Google's own apps, for example, I installed Gmail and this effectively provides a way for me to access my two Gmail accounts on the phone. " created="Wed, 16 Oct 2024 15:05:41 GMT" type="outline"/>
					<outline text="One thing I don't understand about Private Space are notifications. Every Android app seems to request notifications to be allowed, so for example, will I see any notifications for new email that comes in the mailbox tied to the Private Space? The information in the Private Space settings say that it is not suitable for apps that get critical notifications or need to run in the background because they are closed when the Space locks, which happens when the phone locks. I might have expected the notifications to queue and appear when I open the Private Space but so far that doesn't seem to be the case." created="Wed, 16 Oct 2024 15:17:44 GMT"/>

BTW, found that I cannot use Ctrl+U to underline text because that is used by Drummer to move a node up. However, I can manually enter the underline HTML tags.

				<outline text="The Old School publisher is expecting OPML nodes to have a defined type, and it expects those types to be outline, link, or I think rss. RSS node types are used to create an OPML RSS subscription list for RSS feed (news) readers like River5 and NetNewsWire. I use &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleoutliner.com&quot;&gt;Little Outliner&lt;/a&gt; to maintain &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.scripting.com/?url=http://writing.frankmcpherson.org/myOutlines/rssSubscriptions.opml&quot;&gt;my RSS subscription list&lt;/a&gt; that is stored in an S3 bucket that my instance of River5 accesses. Whenever I want to test a RSS reader I give it the URL of that feed. Note that the OPML file stored on my server running River5 &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fmcpherson/RSSSubscriptionLists/blob/master/1-MySubs.opml&quot;&gt;includes the subscription list&lt;/a&gt; stored in S3, which is how I add feeds to &lt;a href=&quot;http://river.frankm.info:1337/&quot;&gt;my river of news&lt;/a&gt; without having to log on to the server." created="Fri, 29 Oct 2021 14:41:34 GMT" type="outline"/>

I created it by putting cursor on the date and pressing ENTER, then typing the text, selecting the entire node, clicking the link button on the toolbar and entering the URL. As you can see, the difference between this and an HTML link and anchor is that the text is not the link the the URL displays as the link, where as with an anchor the text is the link and you don't see the URL.

				<outline text="I am wondering what the relationship might be between long form writing, Drummer, and Old School. What I think I would like is that not all of a titled post would appear on the main blog page, instead you would get the blog title, an intro slug, and a &lt;i&gt;Read more&lt;/i&gt; link to the full titled post page. For example, look at what I wrote about &lt;a href=&quot;http://oldschool.scripting.com/frankm/2021/10/16/202239.html?title=digitalOceanAppPlatform&quot;&gt;Digital Ocean App Platform&lt;/a&gt; on October 16. That post/article/story is seven paragraphs long and I don't think all seven should be on &lt;a href=&quot;http://oldschool.scripting.com/frankm/2021/10/16.html&quot;&gt;the October 16 page&lt;/a&gt; nor the main page of the blog, mostly because it makes those pages unnecessarily longer.  I think I would create a story node type that treated the node as the story title and sub nodes as the body of the story, rendered that on a separate page (as titled posts are now) and rendered just the title and a intro of 3 sentences with a link to the full story on the blog day and main blog pages. One can manually make this happen by creating a separate OPML file for each story, have that file rendered by pagePark, and manually create the title and intro post on the blog. Problem is, I want the story pages to be rendered like titled posts and not how pagePark renders OPML files today. For some reason I want to say Fargo had a feature like this." created="Thu, 28 Oct 2021 19:08:01 GMT" type="outline"/>

The Pixel 6 and 6 Pro are priced very favorably and is going to put to test the question of whether a well designed Android phone can seriously compete with the iPhone. It looks like Google is all-in on marketing the Pixel 6. The question is, when one walks in to a Best Buy or a AT&amp;T store which phone do people in those stores steer customers toward? Another question is going to be build quality. Google has suffered in the past with defective devices that leave bad impressions so they must step up their quality control game. Only time will tell.

Several weeks ago I used pagePark to test out App Platform and I ran into problems accessing sites generated from OPML because Chrome blocked mixed content with the generated HTML.

					<outline text="To test App Platform I forked a copy of the pagePark repo to my Github account and added a package.json to it that was created from another installation of pagePark I had on a computer on my home network, because it is required for the App Platform deployment.

At the time I did not know, or understand, the s3.amazonaws.com versions of the link and script tags in the html so my resolution to the browser mixed content issue was to curl copies of all the associated files and put them in a code subdirectory of the domain. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fmcpherson/pagePark/blob/master/templates/opml/template.txt&quot;&gt;Here is how&lt;/a&gt; the opml template text file looked after I made the changes." created="Sat, 16 Oct 2021 20:41:59 GMT"/>

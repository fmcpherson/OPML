					<outline text="For grins, I am &lt;a href=&quot;https://orgmodeforbeginners.com/&quot;&gt;taking another look at org mode&lt;/a&gt;, which is an editing add-on to emacs. As far as I can tell the intent of org mode is to provide outline  functionality to emacs, but the  key thing to know is that emacs pre-dates graphical user interfaces, so for it to graphically depict an outline it uses asterisks. One of the keys, I think, to understanding org mode is to realize the focus of it is really on the keyboard bindings that make it easier to edit an outline without using a mouse. " created="Fri, 26 Jan 2024 16:45:15 GMT" type="outline"/>
					<outline text="One can say that the above really defines emacs, those who use it proficiently and evangelize its functionality to do because they have built the  memory muscle to write, edit, move text, and navigate within files (documents) quickly via the keyboard.  " created="Fri, 26 Jan 2024 16:49:54 GMT" type="outline"/>
					<outline text="But, when I look at an outline in emacs/org mode I am not sure what I think I see is in fact an outline. Outlines predate computers, and outlines written on paper with pencil are graphical; child branches (nodes) are indented beneath the parent branches and so your eyes easily see the structure, which is in fact the whole point of an outline. I don't see that structure when I look at an outline in org mode, I see a series of lines with a number preceding asterisks, which is basically a list. " created="Fri, 26 Jan 2024 16:51:41 GMT" type="outline"/>
					<outline text="All this prologue to ask the question, what really is an outline and what is an outline editor? I am writing this in Drummer and I easily and quickly recognize this text is in an outline form because there is a structure of indentation that shows child and parent nodes. Drummer also clearly demonstrates the value of the mouse. In Drummer to collapse the child nodes of a parent I simply double-click the parent node, which I find intuitive. With org mode enabled, one presses the Tab key to expand and collapse. Fast yes, but is it intuitive? " created="Fri, 26 Jan 2024 16:56:28 GMT" type="outline"/>
					<outline text="Seems to me that the real primary benefit of using org mode is that your data is stored in a &quot;plain&quot; text file format that makes the data the most portable because one can open and easily read those files using an editor on any computing platform known to man. My files created and edited using Drummer are also in a text format but it includes markup that has the purpose of being understood by a computer more so than by a human. I can open the Drummer OPML files using an editor on any computing platform known to man but it is not going to be as legible in that editor as an org mode file is going to be.  " created="Fri, 26 Jan 2024 17:02:44 GMT" type="outline"/>
					<outline text="The debate here then is on what is the most important to oneself, future proofing of the accessibility and legibility of what is written, or the lower cognitive load of using modern tools, by which I mean the computer mouse, to navigate and manipulate an outline? I think &lt;a href=&quot;https://frankmcpherson.blog/2024/01/25/i-had-not.html&quot;&gt;the computer mouse&lt;/a&gt; and outlines are natural siblings, and it seems silly to me to not use the technology that is available to me.

My work study assignment was the undergraduate computer science lab that was for all practical purposes put together specifically to be the home for six of the newly minted Macs. The CS department used the lab for teaching an experimental class in Pascal, but also came equipped with MacWrite and MacPaint. I was immediately enamored by these little computers that I had the good fortune to use whenever there were no other students using them, and I lusted over them for all five years I was in school. The price for the Macs were well out of my price range as were the IBM PCs that I could buy on a student discount. The first computer that I purchased was an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.computinghistory.org.uk/det/3959/Atari-800XL/&quot;&gt;Atari 800XL&lt;/a&gt; during my sophmore year, which I used for programming classes via VT100 terminal emulation connection to a mainframe and for writing papers. After I got my first job I bought an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.myoldcomputers.com/museum/computers/atari_1040st.htm&quot;&gt;Atari 1040ST&lt;/a&gt;, which mimics the Mac UI but cost much less.

				<outline text="Syncing Files With The Note Air 3C" created="Tue, 23 Jan 2024 21:38:09 GMT" type="outline">
					<outline text="I bought the Boox Note Air 3C for the ability to better hand write notes in digital ink and to read with less eye strain. Reading and writing with any mobile device means you are going to need a way to get files on and off the mobile device. Curiously, Boox treats synchronization of the native notes apps different from annotations made with the native reading app. " created="Tue, 23 Jan 2024 21:39:04 GMT" type="outline"/>
					<outline text="Part of the set up process is configuring the Note Air 3C to use one of several different public clouds by what Boox calls &quot;binding&quot; your public cloud account to the device. I choose OneDrive and after binding that account a new &quot;onyx&quot; folder was created in my OneDrive files that has a subfolder named &quot;NoteAir 3C&quot; and within that are two subfolders, &quot;Notepads&quot; and &quot;Reading Notes.&quot; As far as I can tell the only thing that ends up in these folders is the output of the native Notes app. " created="Tue, 23 Jan 2024 21:44:18 GMT"/>
					<outline text="The &quot;Notepads&quot; folder contains PDF copies of each notepad one creates in Notes, I believe this corresponds to the sync format option I select in the Sync Settings of the Notes app. The &quot;Reading Notes&quot; contain copies of Notepads that are associated to the &quot;books&quot; (PDFs or ePub) that one is reading and created via the split view mode. It appears that once the handwritten notes notepad is first created in split view you can then open that notepad like any other and continue reading, but basically that one file is what opens when you select to open handwritten notes in split view." created="Tue, 23 Jan 2024 21:50:51 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I should add that during the device set up you also create an account in what is called the Onyx Cloud that has servers in the United States and Europe. Here too, only PDF copies of your notepads are synced along with data about PDFs and ePub books you read.  As far as I can tell the reading data is basically what page you are on and what percentage of the &quot;book&quot; you have read. It looks like there is an ability to turn off syncing of notes to the Onyx account, but there is a warning about manual sync being disabled after you turn it off. It looks like you can also configure to sync the &quot;.note&quot; file that is a BOOX exclusive format, but you can only select one of the format options." created="Tue, 23 Jan 2024 21:49:05 GMT"/>
					<outline text="Bottom line is that PDF copies of the notepads that I create on the Boox Note Air 3C are written to OneDrive and can also be written to the Onyx Cloud or can be configured to only be written to the cloud storage of your choice. What is not written to either of these locations are any books, PDFS or ePub, that you copy to and possibly annotate on the device. Because you can annotate PDFs, it is common to use PDFs as templates for specific formated notepad like daily planners or meeting planners, however what is important to know is what you do annotate is not automatically backed up to any of the sync locations you may have created for your Notepads." created="Tue, 23 Jan 2024 22:43:38 GMT"/>
					<outline text="So far I have not found where the notepad files are actually stored in the storage of the device. The only files I can see via the Storage tab of the device are the book files (PDFs or ePub) that appear when I tap Documents from the storage tab, but what displays on the Storage tab appears to be a label for file types and most like the files you see in Documents are actually stored in the Books folder on the device." created="Tue, 23 Jan 2024 22:39:54 GMT"/>
					<outline text="One can add or &quot;push&quot; book files to the Note Air using the BOOXDrop app, which is a web browser that runs on the device that you can access via a home network using the IP address provided by the app, but this doesn't provide an easy way to sync annotated books back to another device. What I have done is install SyncThing on the NoteAir and peered it with a server running in my home network. I also have SyncThing installed on my desktop computer and have configured the desktop, server, and NoteAir to share a folder. The folder I am sharing on the NoteAir 3C is the Books folder, and so whenever a file in that folder changes the changed file is synchronized to my server and also with the desktop computer. I can then open that PDF on my desktop when I want and well as easily copy/sync PDFs from my desktop to the Note Air. " created="Tue, 23 Jan 2024 22:48:34 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I don't keep SyncThing continually running on the Note Air, though I could configure it do so, but that comes at a cost of battery life. I prefer to manually control synchronization by starting up and existing the app. I use SyncThing in this same way on my Pixel 7a smartphone to make a local backup copy of my photos.

				<outline text="Parting Ways With Evernote" created="Mon, 22 Jan 2024 19:17:05 GMT" type="outline">
					<outline text="Today I canceled my subscription and closed by account with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evernote&quot;&gt;Evernote&lt;/a&gt;, which most will think a trivial event. People stop using software all the time, except I've been using Evernote from the beginning that it first became available for Windows in 2008. In fact, I am pretty sure that I first used a beta version of the product perhaps as early as 2005. At the time it was introduced no company was really developing notetaking software, at least not for Windows. When first introduced the UI of EverNote had the form of a continual scroll of information &quot;flagged&quot; by date, in fact it could be my first experience with the newsfeed/stream UI now commonly used by social networking applications. " created="Mon, 22 Jan 2024 19:17:20 GMT" type="outline"/>
					<outline text="The closest resemblance EverNote had to any other product was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pinterest.com/pin/newton-os-gui--369998925635580915/&quot;&gt;the UI of the Newton OS&lt;/a&gt; that ran on Apple's Newton Messagepad.  The resemblance may have been intentional because EverNote was founded by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepan_Pachikov&quot;&gt;Stepan Pachikov&lt;/a&gt; who with his company Paragraph International, lead the development of the handwriting recognition engine known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://apple.fandom.com/wiki/CalliGrapher&quot;&gt;CalliGrapher&lt;/a&gt;, which was licensed by Apple for use with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton_OS&quot;&gt;Newton OS&lt;/a&gt;. EverNote's resemblance to Newton definitely drew my attention to the product. " created="Mon, 22 Jan 2024 19:24:23 GMT" type="outline"/>
					<outline text="Pachikov brought &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Libin&quot;&gt;Phil Libin&lt;/a&gt; onboard as CEO of Evernote (originally the product name had a capitalized N that was changed to lowercase by 2008) and Libin grew the company and the product into the well recognized, multi-platform product that most people know of it today. In my opinion what made Evernote attractive is that it centrally stored data (perhaps one of the first commercial client/server applications) that is accessible to client applications running on nearly every computing platform that I use. At a time when it was common to see applications that ran only on Mac or Windows, or iOS, Evernote ran any every single one of these platforms. " created="Mon, 22 Jan 2024 19:32:15 GMT" type="outline"/>
					<outline text="Of course, developing and then maintaining separate code bases for each platform is daunting, particularly if the application architecture was not explicitly developed for that use, and so over time bugs crept up that caused problems. The relatively fast growth of the product also lead to performance issues, and for some data loss.  For me Evernote &lt;a href=&quot;https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpingTheShark&quot;&gt;jumped the shark&lt;/a&gt; around 2013 when the company began licensing/selling products with Evernote branding, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.engadget.com/2016-02-02-evernote-online-market-closes.html&quot;&gt;like socks&lt;/a&gt;, that had no relationship to the core product, while there were significant problems with the Evernote app. One year after Libin left Evernote the company stopped selling these products. " created="Mon, 22 Jan 2024 19:44:16 GMT" type="outline"/>
					<outline text="It might be said that Evernote began its path of decent soon after Libin left the company in 2015. Key developers started to leave the company and  soon there  seemed to be yearly rumors of the company going under. While many who I associated with stopped using it, by 2015 I had accumulated seven years of information in the application and I felt the yearly $60 subscription was worth my continued access to that information from all the devices I use. The Evernote web clipper had become my most valued tool of all the software I use and it is still the best browser web clipping application available particularly on mobile devices. Unlike most other apps, sharing to Evernote on iOS and Android captures the entire web page rather than just the link to the page. " created="Mon, 22 Jan 2024 19:53:00 GMT" type="outline"/>
					<outline text="So, despite the dismal outlook for the company and the app, I stayed committed to it, but last year it was acquired by Bending Spoons and they changed &lt;a href=&quot;https://evernote.com/compare-plans&quot;&gt;the subscription cost to $15 per month&lt;/a&gt;, which I decided was too expensive in light of what I pay in other software subscriptions. When the rumors of the demise of Evernote started appearing I began testing ways to export my information out of the application and import it into others. Two years ago I exported everything from Evernote to OneNote, which wasn't perfect but good enough for me to find information should I need to. Last year I found I could also import my Evernote archive into Obsidian, which I completed last fall and from that point stopped storing new information in Evernote. " created="Mon, 22 Jan 2024 20:00:02 GMT" type="outline"/>
					<outline text="My yearly subscription with Evernote renews at the end of January, so my deadline to delete my data from Evernote and close my account was this past weekend. Deleting my notes was much more laborious than I would have preferred, as a deleted note is moved to Trash and then one has to empty the Trash in order to completely delete the note and I found that Trash emptying seemed to only handle about 100 notes or so at a time, particularly with the web application. The problem seems to be with the synchronization performance, even the web app syncs data with the browser local storage, and I suspect there is Javasript handling all of the API calls to tell Evernote's servers to move and delete data. " created="Mon, 22 Jan 2024 20:06:36 GMT" type="outline"/>
					<outline text="I am obviously much more brand loyal than most other people, so it's really a big deal for me personally to stop using a product after having used it for more than ten years. Obviously, my issue is not with the product itself but the subscription cost that most likely is driven by a decreasing number of subscribers. I do expect Evernote to eventually disappear within the next year or two. Going forward I am using &lt;a href=&quot;https://joplinapp.org/help/&quot;&gt;Joplin&lt;/a&gt; to capture web clippings from Mac and Linux, tolerating the fact that sharing to Joplin with iPad only captures the link and not the web content. I have also started using &lt;a href=&quot;https://archivebox.io/&quot;&gt;Archivebox&lt;/a&gt; on my home network. I am using end to end encryption with Joplin and using OneDrive as the &quot;hub&quot; for storing/syncing the data in Joplin between my desktops and iPad. Unfortunately the Android version of Joplin does not synchronize well and I gave up even trying to use it on my Pixel 7a. " created="Mon, 22 Jan 2024 20:11:55 GMT" type="outline"/>

If you are familiar with the Amazon Kindles but not familiar with eInk screens, they are the type of screen in the Kindles. Unlike traditional Kindles, the Note Air 3C supports writing and reading. If you have heard of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://remarkable.com/store/remarkable-2&quot;&gt;Remarkable tablets&lt;/a&gt;, the Note Air 3C is a competing product with which writing is as near to paper and pencil/pen as possible.

					<outline text="I see a lot of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mlive.com/lions/2024/01/yes-dan-campbell-kept-receipts-on-the-haters-of-detroits-rebuild.html&quot;&gt;articles&lt;/a&gt; about the turnaround of the Detroit Lions, but I don't think any of them get to the true reason. Dan Campbell and his coaching staff are pretty much all former NFL players, and I think that really matters to change the culture of an NFL team. First off the culture is about the players, and so it is formed by leaders who can relate to the players, most who have good B.S. detectors. The best example of this is the rate at which Campbell decides to keep the offense out on fourth down rather than punt.  " created="Tue, 16 Jan 2024 15:26:28 GMT" type="outline"/>
					<outline text="I don't know if this is a fact, but I think it is true that historically the higher percentage of teams who &quot; go for it&quot; on fourth down is coached by former players, for example &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/ron-rivera-riverboat-ron-nickname-commanders-coach/1a57d21b60ca163e11f8348e&quot;&gt;Ron Rivera&lt;/a&gt;. Not much written about why this is the case, but I bet if you polled offensive players a majority would rather &quot;go for it&quot; than punt on fourth and short because they would rather control their own fate than give up the ball to the opponent. By their nature football players are aggressive. " created="Tue, 16 Jan 2024 15:31:24 GMT" type="outline"/>
					<outline text="Some coaches will talk about being aggressive, but in the game are anything but, and that is not Dan Campbell, and that earns him the respect of his players. Lions fans use the phrase &quot;Same Old Lions (SOL)&quot; that describes a history in which one way or another something, a mistake, a penalty, or bad call by a ref, will prevent the Lions from winning. How do you overcome SOL? By not waiting for something bad to happen!" created="Tue, 16 Jan 2024 15:34:15 GMT" type="outline"/>
					<outline text="After the Lions lost to the Cowboys due in part to Campbell deciding to go for a 2 point conversion after a touchdown to take a 1 point lead with a minute or less to go in the game, many were critical of Campbell's decision. Here is the thing, that moment in that game was not just about winning the game, it was another step in dispelling SOL once and for all! Campbell is not afraid to make that decision that could and did not work because in making the decision he is achieving his bigger goal of changing the culture and turning the Lions in to a winning franchise. Clearest evidence of this is Campbell's post game comments stating in effect that he told his players, presumably before the game, that if that situation where to happen they were going for the win. Even when the Lions were backed up seven yards he still went for it, because he had to for the bigger picture." created="Tue, 16 Jan 2024 15:37:27 GMT" type="outline"/>
					<outline text="And now, Campbell appears to be vindicated. Not only did the Lions win their first playoff game in 32 years, but they are now the second seed in the NFC and host another playoff game at home, which would have been the result if they had won that game in Dallas. In fact, an argument can be made everything worked out in the best manner for the Lions because the Packers had the best chance of beating Dallas in Dallas. " created="Tue, 16 Jan 2024 15:41:44 GMT" type="outline"/>
					<outline text="Enjoy the ride Lions fans, you deserve it. You are fortunate that your team finally has the leadership, void of the prima donnas of the past, not only capable of providing one hit wonders but a franchise that wins more than loses because they are committed to &lt;a href=&quot;https://simonsinek.com/books/the-infinite-game/&quot;&gt;the infinite game&lt;/a&gt;. Now is the time to not get too high nor too low, and have faith in that the Campbell and Holmes know what they are doing. " created="Tue, 16 Jan 2024 15:45:55 GMT" type="outline"/>

My thinking is really it only applies to the general election but even then it might only apply to the electoral college election and Congress. In otherwords, won't it apply to the final decision makers, and that is either the general or electoral college elections. Now, a sane political party ought to want to know whether the candidate's they have running are qualified to hold the office and wouldn't want to put disqualified persons in their primary, but for most point of views sanity is not a factor of political parties." created="Fri, 12 Jan 2024 15:54:23 GMT" type="outline"/>

One asks Rabbit to play music and LAM uses the Spotify API to identify and play the music that fulfills the request. The demo shows how one can interact to play another song from the same album as the song currently playing or ask who has covered the song. Also demoed were requests for a ride, fulfilled via Uber, and order a pizza, fulfilled via Door Dash.

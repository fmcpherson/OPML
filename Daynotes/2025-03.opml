Really what we are living through is the beginning of the fall of the American Empire that rose in place starting on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki&quot;&gt;August 6, 1945&lt;/a&gt;. Washington D.C. is being sacked while most of the nation cheers because the empire has been only serving a minority of citizens. Unfortunately, our tunnel vision prevents us from even considering what might come next." created="Mon, 31 Mar 2025 15:50:49 GMT" type="outline"/>

I wish a broader question would be asked. If the founders thought a quid pro quo relationship with U.S officials were bad, why is that relationship worse with foreign states than domestically? In my opinion, these domestic relationships, which include lobbying, are equally bad. Given how much money it takes to win an office, the dependency and consequences are worse!

					<outline text="What makes liberty, which I define as personal autonomy, real in America are two fundamental things: " created="Wed, 19 Mar 2025 15:21:04 GMT" type="markdown"/>

					<outline text="We usually refer to these two items as **due process** and without it there is no liberty. Further, in our Declaration of Independence we stated that all people, not just U.S. Citizens, are endowed by their creator the right to liberty. Liberty is not provided by the state, it is inherent to who we are as humans. Further, we declared that we create governments for the purposes of preserving these rights." created="Wed, 19 Mar 2025 15:25:22 GMT"/>
					<outline text="What are crimes is defined by laws. With the aim of protecting our liberty from individuals and groups who would take it away, which we declared is the purpose of government, our founders created a government that rules by laws, laws written and passed by legislatures made up of people who are voted in to office by citizens to be their representative. This is our form of self government that made America unique in the world at it's founding, and I do not understand how anyone can honestly say the words &quot;Make America Great Again&quot; without accepting and respecting this fundamental tenant." created="Wed, 19 Mar 2025 15:28:55 GMT"/>

				<outline text="I don't think the majority of the human species has learned well the lessons of World War II. The fundamental lessons of World War II is that humanity has the willingness and the capability to destroy itself. In other words, humanity can, and without the required maturity will, cause it's own extinction. The United States emphatically demonstrated this in dropping nuclear bombs on Japan. For most of my life we have lived in the fear of this knowledge, aka the fear of nuclear war, but we have not really learned the lessons about how we need to change. Wars and weapons of war are rooted in fear. Greed is really driven by fear. I think that fear is driven by seeing ourselves as apart from the other, which I think is the point of the story in Genesis 3." created="Tue, 18 Mar 2025 14:21:28 GMT" type="outline"/>
